Today is a super exciting nw project, I've NEVER seen anyone do this before, Jackie from NerdEcrafter and I have decided to try customizing plushies for the first time. This is a lot like squishy makeovers, but with plushies instead!

Since this has never been done before, we are having to get very experimental. I ended up using a combination of techniques and materials to give my plushie a makeover. I will be doing some basic sewing, gluing, using felt, ribbon, and lots of fabric paint as usual! We decided to us Squishmallows to customize since they are so simple and really cute. Get ready for some cute plushie creations üòä

___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________

Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL). 

CURRENT SERIES:
Squishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewers
Thrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard sales
Bake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real life
Create This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)

My massive colony of fire ants (Phoenix Empire) are moving into their new Avatar-themed floating mountains paludarium, called the Ember Islands. I need to plan the emigration properly so to make it as sooth as possible for the ants and the queen. What I observed during the move was incredible and an experience I'll never forget. Ant love forever! This video was shot in 4K Ultra HD resolution. #FireAnts #FloatingMountains #AntFarm

I had so much fun #Trying #Baking a #Cake in a Crock Pot Slow Cooker for the first time ever! I can't believe how well this worked after a little trial and error. I tested it a bunch of different ways and this is the one that worked the best. I've also started to test bake other recipes in my slow cooker like brownies and other fun desserts!

Check out Moriah's video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNhebYZurE0 . Moriah's Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/MoriahElizabeth/featured . I'm so happy to be able to work with my friend again. We wanted to make a unique and fun DIY craft that we've never seen being done on youtube before. Much like Squishy Makeovers, this diy project transforms squishmallows into custom dolls. This is the first custom doll plushies I've ever made and they are ooak! I used Tulip fabric paints, acrylic paints, solarcolordust airbrush, and felt...and of course SPRINKLES.
 
@Moriah Elizabeth and I were supposed to have a fun in-person collaboration this summer, but with everything going on, we decided to do this fun idea instead. We went with the idea that we would make one plushie in the style of the other (I would make one sweet and 2 darkness creatures), and she would make (1 darkness, and 2 sweetness). I'm so happy to have creative friends in our community.

As I currently don't know what to restore next, I decided to make the 8 ball. It was a very cool little project. Very accurate work was needed to get all six individual pieces fit together with no gaps. The hardest part of this project was filming the last few shots, because it is so super shiny now and reflects everything. I really like how it turned out and it will be a nice decoration piece to look at.

I hope you like my work and the video.

Lyrics:
Had to do maybach 
I can‚Äôt do a regular Benz 
I like the seats that recline 
Know I‚Äôm dog 
Yes I‚Äôm fuckin her and her friend 
I like em two at a time 
And She wanna slide she pull out her insta and shit
She go if she fuck up the vibe 
How am I 23 sittin on 23 I feel like Jordan 
I‚Äôm back in my prime (2x)

This years in the makin shit why would I lie 
Dreamed of the whip now I don‚Äôt even drive 
I got a chauffeur 
She told me I‚Äôm drivin her crazy 
She hate what I‚Äôm doin online 
10 in a week and I‚Äôm just not suprised
I had to take that one home to the guys 
I got the feds watchin 
Haters watchin 
News watchin that‚Äôs a whole lotta eyes 
I went and Flooded my wrist 
For the fuck of this shit 

While these rappers just run out of time 
I‚Äôm here forever 
This lives televised 
Ain‚Äôt no way they could take none from any of mine 
That boy a vette 
And he still on the rise 
Rolls or the Bentley shit I can‚Äôt decide 
I got the paparazzi at the front of my door 
I can‚Äôt leave shit I need a disguise

Had to do maybach 
I can‚Äôt do a regular Benz 
I like the seats that recline 
Know I‚Äôm dog 
Yes I‚Äôm fuckin her and her friend 
I like em two at a time 
And She wanna slide she pull out her insta and shit
She go if she fuck up the vibe 
How am I 23 sittin on 23 I feel like Jordan 
I‚Äôm back in my prime (2x)"

Lyrics

One more tear drop
The surface tension breaks
And if the surface tension breaks
Then I will pour my pain and more

Then my heart stops
What will it take
Cos if it breaks,‚ÄØif it breaks
Cos if it does
I'll turn to dust

One foot in the past and one foot in the future
I need to take a class on staying right here with you

I'm drowning in my history, prisoner of past defeats
Tell me‚ÄØwhat the future‚ÄØholds, tell me baby
I'm terrified of things to come
Paralyzed, I cannot run
Tell me‚ÄØwhat the future‚ÄØholds, tell me baby

Stuck in quicksand, I think of us
I think of us in my mirage
I can't get out
And I'm scared now

One foot in the past and one foot in the future
I need to take a class on staying right here with you

I'm drowning in my history, prisoner of past defeats
Tell me‚ÄØwhat the future‚ÄØholds, tell me baby
I'm terrified of things to come
Paralyzed, I cannot run
Tell me‚ÄØwhat the future‚ÄØholds, tell me baby

So kiss me 'til the break of dawn
And I will lie here in your arms
And I will try to live tonight like it's the last day of my life
'Cuz‚ÄØI love you baby, please save me...
From my mind

I'm drowning in my history, prisoner of past defeats
Tell me‚ÄØwhat the future‚ÄØholds, tell me baby
I'm terrified of things to come
Paralyzed, I cannot run
Tell me‚ÄØwhat the future‚ÄØholds, tell me baby

I'm drowning in my history, prisoner of past defeats
Tell me‚ÄØwhat the future‚ÄØholds, tell me baby
I'm terrified of things to come
Paralyzed, I cannot run
Tell me‚ÄØwhat the future‚ÄØholds, tell me baby

I'm terrified of things to come
Paralyzed, I cannot run
Tell me‚ÄØwhat the future‚ÄØholds, tell me baby"

In this Broadcast Award-winning, BAFTA and Emmy Award-nominated entertainment show, Taskmaster tyrant Greg Davies (Man Down, Cuckoo), with the help of his loyal assistant Alex Horne (The Horne Section and the show‚Äôs creator), sets out to test the wiles, wit and wisdom of five hyper-competitive comedians.

Comedians that have risked life, limb, and dignity in the hope of making the Taskmaster proud so far include: Frank Skinner (The Frank Skinner Show), Mel Giedroyc (The Great British Bake Off), Romesh Ranganathan (Asian Provocateur), Hugh Dennis (Outnumbered), Sally Phillips (Bridget Jones‚Äô Diary), Rose Matafeo (Edinburgh Comedy Award Winner 2018), and Russell Howard (The Russell Howard Hour). Unaware of what awaits them in each wax-sealed envelope, only one competitor can become the victorious owner of His Royal Task-ness‚Äô golden head and be crowned the next Taskmaster Champion."

Loyal Theorists, you may be thinking,  Matpat, how can you possibly know off of the trailer?  Never doubt my ability to theorize out of the smallest details!

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be haunted by Colonel Sanders? What could make such a thing a reality? That's where today's theory starts! You see in Japan KFC is HUGELY popular, so much that there are even statues of the Colonel himself. Would you believe that one of those statues is responsible for a CURSE put on a Japanese baseball team? Theorists, this is about to get WEIRD!

Hope For The Day (HFTD) is a non-profit movement empowering the conversation on proactive suicide prevention and mental health education. Join the Proactive Suicide Prevention conversation at http://www.hftd.org 

Suicide Prevention starts with a conversation we're not having with our mental health due to Stigma. The first step to breaking that silence is dispelling stigmas of fear, judgement, and shame about our internal experiences. We achieve that by proclaiming It's Ok Not To Be Ok!

Lyrics:
Feeling like a drop in the ocean that don‚Äôt nobody notice
Maybe it‚Äôs all just in your head
Feeling like you‚Äôre trapped in your own skin, and now your body‚Äôs frozen
Broken down, you‚Äôve got nothing left
When you‚Äôre high on emotion and you‚Äôre losing your focus and you feel too exhausted to pray
Don‚Äôt get lost in the moment or give up when you‚Äôre closest, all you need is somebody to say
It‚Äôs okay not to be okay
It‚Äôs okay not to be okay
When you‚Äôre down and you feel ashamed
It‚Äôs okay not to be okay
Feeling like your life‚Äôs an illusion and lately you‚Äôre secluded
Thinking you‚Äôll never get your chance
Feeling like you got no solution, it‚Äôs only ‚Äòcause you‚Äôre human
No control its out of your hands 
When you‚Äôre high on emotion and you‚Äôre losing your focus and you feel too exhausted to pray
Don‚Äôt get lost in the moment or give up when you‚Äôre closest, all you need is somebody to say
It‚Äôs okay not to be okay
It‚Äôs okay not to be okay
When you‚Äôre down and you feel ashamed
It‚Äôs okay not to be okay
When you‚Äôre high on emotion and you‚Äôre losing your focus and you feel too exhausted to pray
Don‚Äôt get lost in the moment or give up when you‚Äôre closest, all you need is somebody to say
It‚Äôs okay not to be okay
It‚Äôs okay not to be okay
When you‚Äôre down and you feel ashamed
It‚Äôs okay not to be okay
It‚Äôs okay not to be okay

The track, a fusion of dancehall, afrobeats and EDM sounds which takes lyrical inspiration from reggae classics by Black Uhuru and Baby Cham, is the first single from Mr Eazi‚Äôs Something Else EP out in October.

‚ÄúThis record was really fun to make,‚Äù Mr Eazi says, ‚Äúand it‚Äôs crazy how it went from hearing a K4mo intro in the studio with Fred Again, to me jumping on it and then Diplo hopping in! And Walshy hitting me up to say it‚Äôs a banger‚Äînext thing Nicki is on it! Been a journey really, like two years in the making and I can‚Äôt wait to perform it at my next festival!‚Äù

Lyrics 

Knock knock
Guess who‚Äôs coming to dinner?
Fred, Mr Eazi, Major Lazer inna beamer

Oh my gawd
I‚Äôve never seen a bottom like this
See the way she hula-hoop
Come and jump on like this
See the junk in the trunk
I had to bag her right quick
Feel like magic all together
Multiplied by six

Oh my gawd
I‚Äôve never seen a bottom like this
See the way she hula-hoop
Come and jump on like this
See the junk in the trunk
I had to bag her right quick
Feel like magic all together
All together by six

She say she got a partner
Me I got one

But me wan‚Äô tap
What a conundrum

Never seen a girl wey give me vibes suh
Never seen a girl with biggie bum-bum

You know me got a lot of girls around me
Steady give them love give them the honey
And that is why they love to love to love me
(Ay-ya-ya-ya)

Knock knock
Guess who‚Äôs coming to dinner?
Fred, Mr Eazi, Major Lazer inna beamer
Guess who‚Äôs coming to dinner?
(Oh-na-na-na-na)
Zagadat

You know say you got what me want
And I‚Äôma give you whatever you want
So baby come give me some love
(Oh-na-na-na-na-na)

Cuh mi pum pum tun up 
Head ah mash-up, becuz my pum pum tun up
And if I‚Äôm with my Barbie dolls you know the whole crew done up
Yeah, we done up and plus the pum pum tun up (turned up)
 
Stranger, lookin‚Äô for some danger
Ride it like a bad gyal, face of an angel
This one here ah major, UK out to Asia
Pull out in da Range, got‚Äôem beepin‚Äô like a pager

You know say I‚Äôma give you want (want)
You know I got a body, you can flaunt (flaunt)
You let me come first, I‚Äôm in the front
He like kickin‚Äô it with Chun, I‚Äôma diss him when I‚Äôm done
‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm back in my bag
Throw your rag, throw your flag
And I‚Äôm runnin‚Äô up a tab, ‚Äòcause I love poppin‚Äô tags
Got moscato in my cup, poppin‚Äô bottles in the club
He said ‚ÄúKnock, knock?‚Äù I said ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs that?‚Äù

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke. "

Lyrics:
 
‚ÄôNeath a crowd of mongrel trees
I pulled that bothersome thread
Got down on my knees
Grabbed my pen and bowed my head
Tried to summon all that my heart finds true
And send it in my letter to you
 
Things I found out through hard times and good
I wrote ‚Äôem all out in ink and blood
Dug deep in my soul and signed my name true
And sent it in my letter to you
 
In my letter to you
I took all my fears and doubts
In my letter to you
All the hard things I found out
In my letter to you
All that I‚Äôve found true
And I sent it in my letter to you
 
I took all the sunshine and rain
All my happiness and all my pain
The dark evening stars
And the morning sky of blue
And I sent it in my letter to you
And I sent it in my letter to you
 
In my letter to you
I took all my fears and doubts
In my letter to you
All the hard things that I found out
In my letter to you
All that I found true
And I sent it in my letter to you
I sent it in my letter to you

For 2021 he replaces Sergio Perez, and will slot in alongside Lance Stroll. It's a marquee signing for the team's Aston rebrand next year, and gives it a world champion driver at a time when it wants to take the next step up to becoming a race-winning team. But is success for this partnership a slam dunk? In this video, Scott Mitchell looks at the risks on both sides, as Vettel hopes the team can build some real upward momentum, Racing Point banks on getting the fired-up version of Vettel, and we take a moment to spare a thought for Perez for being left on the sidelines by a team he has played a pivotal role with for many years.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit ‚Äî stripped-down sets, an intimate setting ‚Äî just a different space.

For her Tiny Desk (home) concert, Phoebe Bridgers chose the White House. OK, maybe it's a green screen, but she and her team created a sweet mock-up of the Oval Office, with Phoebe performing behind a very special desk. It's a far cry from the hotel bed in Austin we first filmed Phoebe on back in 2017, but her ambitions and talent run high. She played the Tiny Desk later that year and returned with newfound bandmates, Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker, as boygenius one year later. But there was more to come when she surprised us all for a magical collaboration with her musical hero Conor Oberst as Better Oblivion Community Center just six months later.

Phoebe and bandmates Marshall Vore on drums and Harrison Whitford on guitar perform three songs from her brilliant new album, Punisher. They open with  Kyoto,  a story song based on her first trip to Japan, followed with a sweet version of  Moon Song  and the sad details of loving someone who doesn't love themself. And then comes the kicker, as Phoebe introduces herself with the words  I hope everybody's enjoying their apocalypse,  as the band kicks into her surreal doomsday tune  I Know the End.  And what an end it is: The trio expands to an ensemble and a crowd-sourced chorus of fans ‚Äî recording from bedrooms, cars, backyards and trampolines ‚Äî lets out the kind of cathartic scream that has come to define 2020 for so many of us.

Phoebe for President, 2020.

I build up a new enduro MTB before going to Germany to ride the sickest jumps and freeride MTB lines of the year! How sick is this bike?

Thanks to Ghost bikes I was able to receive this amazing new bike, the 4.7 slamr which is a 140mm front and 130mm rear suspension enduro bike which doubles up as a big slopestyle bike and its perfect! I build up the bike at home and do some fresh modifications to the bike including new halo wheels and Magura brakes before heading for a tiny test ride at my local woods. I also introduce you to my new car that i'm sure you will love! After landing a couple of tricks at home it was then time to leave and make my way across Europe into Germany to ride the Audi Nines freeride event. On arrival at the Audi Nines quarry I jump straight into a course walk through all of the new features that are on offer throughout this crazy bikers dream! For today's video I session the slopestyle line on my new enduro bike and end up pulling off some sick tricks that i never though would be possible on this bike. I will be out here in Germany for a week filled with riding with my jump bike, downhill bike, electric bike and my new enduro mountain bike! I'm very excited to see what the week brings, what tricks would you like to see? Let me know in the comments!! 


I hope you enjoy the video!

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said  we must act  to avoid another lockdown as virus cases rise in England. He set out a new  rule of six , restricting gatherings to a maximum of six people, enforced by police able to issue fines or make arrests. Mr Johnson also outlined a  moonshot  plan to control the virus with mass testing, possibly by next spring. It comes as the UK reported another 2,659 coronavirus cases, the fourth day running of over 2,000 reported cases.  I want to be absolutely clear, these measures are not another national lockdown. The whole point of them is to avoid a second national lockdown,  Mr Johnson said.

Get the full story üëâ https://bbc.in/3bHcVkK

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson took to the lectern in Downing Street to deliver a coronavirus briefing.  He was joined by chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, and chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance.

So, what did he and his scientific advisers, Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance, say?

    Cases have risen sharply in recent weeks, especially among 17- to 21-year-olds
    The rise is not limited to a few local areas but has been seen across the country
    The PM said it was  time to act  and introduced new measures in England from Monday, including  the rule of six  to limit the number of people who can gather together
    There will be exemptions, such as for weddings and funerals, as well as in gyms and restaurants, but fines will be introduced for all those who break the rules
    Hospitality venues will be legally required to collect contact details from customers, or face fines
    Johnson also confirmed the government was working on a  moonshot  mass testing plan for tests that can give results in less than 20 minutes
    There will be a pilot on entertainment venues in Salford next month so people who test negative on the door can go and see shows
    He hopes to roll this out nationally, but we will need to wait for the results.

No, it was not.
The utter lack of care and direction regarding the sequel trilogy has me beyond bothered. I found it hard to find my words in this first time reaction and realization that we've really truly been all lied to regarding everything.

The Mandalorian is all I have to look forward to.
With Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni behind Star Wars, there is hope. As far as the sequels go, they're no longer in my timeline of Star Wars canon.

I don't think the actors should ever be to blame. Neither should the writers and directors. You can't expect them to understand Star Wars. The higher ups who sign off on such a thing, especially when appointed by George Lucas like KK was, should have put her foot down and really course corrected things.

Everything is so messed up, and the final nail is in.
I hope things continue under Favreau. He is a new hope.

The Leader of the Opposition, Sir Keir Starmer, asks six questions and the leader of the second largest opposition party asks two.

I get asked a lot about whether being a practicing attorney is like being a lawyer on TV.  I love watching legal movies and courtroom dramas.  It's one of the reasons I decided to become a lawyer.  But sometimes they make me want to pull my hair out because they are ridiculous.  

Today I'm taking a break from representing clients and teaching law students how to kick ass in law school to take on lawyers in the movies and on TV.  While all legal movies and shows take dramatic license to make things more interesting (nobody wants to see hundreds of hours of brief writing), many of them have a grain of truth.  

This is part of a continuing series of  Lawyer Reaction  videos.  Got a legal movie or TV show you'd like me to critique?  Let me know in the comments!  

All clips used for fair use commentary, criticism, and educational purposes.  See Hosseinzadeh v. Klein, 276 F.Supp.3d 34 (S.D.N.Y. 2017); Equals Three, LLC v. Jukin Media, Inc., 139 F. Supp. 3d 1094 (C.D. Cal. 2015). 

Typical legal disclaimer from a lawyer (occupational hazard):  This is not legal advice, nor can I give you legal advice.  Sorry!  Everything here is for informational purposes only and not for the purpose of providing legal advice. You should contact your attorney to obtain advice with respect to any particular issue or problem.  Nothing here should be construed to form an attorney client relationship.

Thousands have told me that anyone can easily miss my first automatic basketball hoop by missing the hoop entirely. That is a really good point and something that I can't let stand. In this video I show you how I devoted several weeks of my life to realizing a basketball hoop that makes your shot go in even if you totally miss the hoop.... it was a lot of fun, and quite a bit more challenging than I was anticipating. Hopefully you enjoy it :)

Although very fun, these videos are very time consuming and expensive. Please consider helping to support the development of these projects through my patreon at http://patreon.com/stuffmadehere

This project was really hard. It was a huge challenge to whittle the 450gigs of footage down into a video that shared my journey of designing and getting this machine working.

I haven't done an animation video in a long time so it's definitely a bit awkward. Brings back anxious but warm memories. I hope you enjoy our attempt at surviving a quiet place. If you haven't checked out our vlog, here's the link:

LYRICS:
 
La la la la la
 
Yeah it‚Äôs been a long night and the mirror‚Äôs telling me to go home
But it‚Äôs been a long time since I felt this good on my own
A lot of years went by with my hands tied up in your ropes
Forever, and ever, no more
 
The midnight sky is the road I‚Äôm taking
Head high up in the clouds
Ohhhh
 
I was born to run I don‚Äôt belong to anyone, oh no
I don‚Äôt need to be loved by you
Fire in my lungs can‚Äôt bite the devil on my tongue, oh no
I don‚Äôt need to be loved by you
See my lips, on her mouth, everybody‚Äôs talking now baby
Ohh, you know it‚Äôs true, yeahh
That I was born to run I don‚Äôt belong to anyone, oh no
I don‚Äôt need to be loved by you
Loved by you‚Ä¶.
 
La la la la la
 
She got her hair pulled back cause the sweat‚Äôs dripping off of her face
Said it ain‚Äôt so bad if I wanna make a couple mistakes
You should know right now that I never stay put in one place
Forever, and ever, no more
 
The midnight sky is the road I‚Äôm taking
Head high up in the clouds
Ohhhh
 
I was born to run I don‚Äôt belong to anyone, oh no
I don‚Äôt need to be loved by you
Fire in my lungs can‚Äôt bite the devil on my tongue, oh no
I don‚Äôt need to be loved by you
See my lips, on her mouth, everybody‚Äôs talking now baby
Ohh, you know it‚Äôs true, yeahhh
That I was born to run I don‚Äôt belong to anyone, oh no
I don‚Äôt need to be loved by you
By you‚Ä¶.
 
Ohhh
 
I don‚Äôt hide, blurry eyes like you
Like you
 
I was born to run I don‚Äôt belong to anyone, oh no
I don‚Äôt need to be loved by you
Fire in my lungs can‚Äôt bite the devil on my tongue, you know
I don‚Äôt need to be loved by you
See his hands round my waist, thought you‚Äôd never be replaced baby
Ohh you know it‚Äôs true, yeah
 
That I was born to run I don‚Äôt belong to anyone, oh no
I don‚Äôt need to be loved by you
 
Yeah‚Ä¶
