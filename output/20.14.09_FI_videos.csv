Lyrics:

Mun luonteessa on monta puutetta, monta seikkaa jotka eiv√§t p√§√§dy balladiin
Mun puolella varjon rajalla on seutu, jonne joskus koirat haudattiin
Mun ois sanottava v√§hemm√§n ehk√§ ja enemm√§n kiitos ei.
Mun ois osuttava paremmin tauluun ja juostava sit jos ei.
Mun ois sanottava enemm√§n anteeks kuin mit√§ m√§ nyt taas tein.
Mun ois lakattava esitt√§m√§st√§, et muka oon normaalein.

Liimaa tai laastarii
kunhan saadaan haava kii
ja tunteet vaihdetuksi l√§√§kkeisiin
Py√∂rii hyrr√§ paikallaan
kun egot hakkaa toisiaan
ja syntyy kuuskyt uutta ongelmaa

En tunnusta yht√§√§n rikosta, jonka oisin tehnyt ilman hyv√§√§ aietta
Kun ongelmiin liittyy liikaa muuttujii, vastauksetkaan ei kest√§ vahvaa ainetta
Sullon k√§dess√§si el√§v√§√§ tulta ja silmiss√§ hiljaisuus
Siin√§ tulessa on el√§v√§ voima, se hetkess√§ raivostuu
Jos s√§ painat sit√§ syd√§nt√§ vasten, sen olemus paljastuu
Mut jos s√§ yrit√§t sen vangita sinne, sun k√§tesi korventuu

Liimaa tai laastarii
kunhan saadaan haava kii
ja tunteet vaihdetuksi l√§√§kkeisiin
Py√∂rii hyrr√§ paikallaan
kun egot hakkaa toisiaan
ja syntyy kuuskyt uutta ongelmaa

Todenn√§k√∂isesti t√§st√§kin alkaa joku typer√§ n√§ytelm√§
jota kukaan ei haluu tai tarvi mut ei saa pys√§ytetty√§.
Siinon aina sama v√§synyt kaari, kun se on k√§ynniss√§.
Mullon enemm√§n kuin ik√§v√§ niit√§ p√§ivi√§ j√§rjiss√§

Paskaa palettiin
maalaan sill√§ tapettiin
ja tarjoon ratkaisuksi probleemiin
Toiset kuolee kerralla, toiset pala kerrallaan
on hirvi√∂ill√§ kukka hiuksissaan

Liimaa tai laastarii
kunhan saadaan haava kii
ja tunteet vaihdetuksi l√§√§kkeisiin
Py√∂rii hyrr√§ paikallaan
kun egot hakkaa toisiaan
ja syntyy kuuskyt uutta ongelmaa"

T√§m√§ on nimitt√§in nyt kolmas osa samaa jatkumoa. Ensin tein Maski-videon sitten jatkotarinana siit√§ Mc Liskoa eli Joelia k√§sittelev√§n videon ja nyt t√§m√§n. Joel oli siis edellisen videon aikana juuri t√§ysi-ik√§istym√§ss√§ ja siten ison muutoksen kynnyksell√§. 

Videon julkaisun j√§lkeen m√§ j√§in miettim√§√§n, mit√§ Joelin el√§m√§√§ mahtoi kuulua. Me kyll√§ oltiin silloin t√§ll√∂in viestitelty Messengeriss√§ ja Instagramissa, mutta m√§ en tiennyt mitenk√§√§n seikkaper√§isesti el√§m√§n viimeisist√§ vaiheista. Siksi siis t√§m√§ video. 

N√§it√§ kysymyksi√§ sain teilt√§ Youtubessa yhteis√∂v√§lilehdelt√§ ja omalta Facebook-sivulta ja IG:st√§.

Harjoitusjoukkojen vahvuus oli noin 650 henkil√∂√§ koostuen varusmiehist√§, reservil√§isist√§ ja henkil√∂kunnasta.

Harjoitukseen liittyi paikallistason viranomaisyhteisty√∂n harjoittelu, jonka tavoitteena oli kehitt√§√§ viranomaisten keskin√§isi√§ toimintavalmiuksia. Viranomaisista mukana olivat Espoon kaupunki ja L√§nsi-Uudenmaan poliisilaitos.

ABOUT PENCILMATION :
Pencilmation is a cartoon channel for everyone, especially not-too-serious grown-ups. It is made with love and a lot of fun by an international team helmed by Ross Bollinger who started the channel alone in his room a long time ago. Follow the new, wacky, and often times quite silly adventures of Pencilmate, Little Blue Man, Pencilmiss and other toons every Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday.

The new trailer for The Batman starring Robert Pattinson looks very interesting... and surprisingly¬†familiar? You see, with all of the hints hidden in the newest trailer - and I don't mean the riddles - I think I've figured out the ending twist of this movie! Loyal Theorists, you may be thinking,  Matpat, how can you possibly know off of the trailer?  Never doubt my ability to theorize out of the smallest details! You see, I think the big twist of this movie will be that The Batman is actually... well you'll need to watch to find out!

Apologies for the long absence, but we are trying to get things back on track. No, this video didn‚Äôt take us 3 months to make - we filmed a bunch of videos in July and this is the first of them to be released! It‚Äôs not a magnum opus, just supposed to be fun and lighthearted. If you want to read more about our plans, you can check out my blog post here:

https://www.safiyasnewintrosong.com/single-post/2020/09/04/where-have-we-been

Now, onto the video! A few weeks ago, somewhere deep in a visual ASMR YouTube rabbit hole, I discovered the online acrylic pour art community - where people essentially make interesting color combos of paint in a cup, then pour that cup onto a canvas or object - and then manipulate that object to create truly mesmerizing, rainbow, psychedelic pieces of art. And I was instantly hooked - just something about the way the paints flow from the cup and then slide around the canvas really got me, ya know? So I decided to pick an acrylic pour art video and try to follow it myself, to see if I could do it too. So I chose a  pouring guru , Tiktus color art, and got to work.

What do you guys think of my ~acrylic pouring adventure~?

Behind the Scenes Video of how we built it: https://youtu.be/E60G3ba4TUA 
‚áä  Click below for more links!  ‚áä

I have been wanting to build this thing as long as I understood the physics of how it all works.  A super big thanks to David Linderman, Jeremy Fielding, Trent, and David Woodall (the welder).

I realize most people who support Smarter Every Day don't do it for  transactional  reasons, (ie, I'll support Smarter Every Day to get stuff).  I also realized that there is often a mental hurdle that must be crossed before support on Patreon starts.  My thought is that I'd really like to give folks a baseball, and it might provide enough momentum to get over that initial hurdle.  I signed the first shipment of baseballs I received, but I only have so many of those.  There's no implication that my signature is worth anything.... it's just kind of what you do with baseballs... it's a tradition.  After a certain number, it will transition to unsigned baseballs.  I've got enough signed baseballs to over all existing Patrons, and many more, but I will wait a month or so to see how many I need to get, then I'll order the second batch.  I like to support jobs and pay people for what they're good at.  The machinists and welders who made the parts in this video for example.  The whole intent here is to diversify away from solely being ad sponsored so I don't have to answer to anyone but myself and Patrons with respect to the types of content I choose to make.  Thank you for understanding what I'm doing here, and even if you decide not to kick in at https://www.patreon.com/smartereveryday , I'm super grateful you took the time to watch this video!  
Thank you very much, 

Destin

Nolan Ryan's fastball has been beat, but when adjusted for radar gun placement it may still be the fastest pitch ever:

Let‚Äôs face it, you have likely been told that eating carbohydrates is making you fat. While there may be some truth to the rumor, it is only because you have been eating them excess. That said, there are some built-in pitfalls that make including carbs in our diets something that we have to be mindful of, however I am going to show you what those are and how to work around them in this video.

The key to fat burning is that you need to be in a hypocaloric state. Due to the tendency we have of overeating carbs there is some logic to the fact that by eliminating them from our diets we will consume fewer calories overall. That said, the replacement of the carbs has to come from somewhere. In the case of keto diets it comes in the form of fats and proteins, mostly from dietary fats. 

The issue with this approach is that the macronutrient we are replacing them with is twice as calorie dense as the carbohydrates themselves. 

Not to mention, it is often the case that the method we use to lose fat and drop weight in the first place is the one we are going to have to continue to use if we want to see long term permanent changes. It is here that I find the keto diet approach difficult to sustain.

So, instead of looking to exclude carbohydrates from your meal plan you need to learn to coexist with them.

That doesn‚Äôt mean that there aren‚Äôt pitfalls that we need to be mindful of however. First there is no denying the fact that carbs taste better and create more cravings than say isolated proteins or fats. It is likely due to the fact that our brains are hard wired to seek out sugars and glucose to fuel its function. Beyond that however is the additional information that carbs are not nearly as satiating as fats or proteins.

So there are definite reasons for why many people are trying to reduce them or even eliminate them from their diets these days but again, I do not believe this sets you up best for long term success. Any diet plan that is deprivation based, while it may help you to lose fat in the short term is not going to be something you can stick with forever.

In general, there are three main categories; simple sugars, complex starches and fibers. Eating carbohydrates from the fibrous carb category will have the least pronounced negative impact on rapidly raising your blood sugar levels and resultant insulin spikes.

The additional fiber present in these foods not only blunts this effect but also makes them more ‚Äúbulky‚Äù food options. Add in the healthy nutrient boost these foods provide with them with plenty of vitamins and minerals and it is easy to see why the majority of the carbs you eat when you are trying to lose fat should come from here.

The simple sugars are the nutrient low carbs that are worth eliminating from your diet if you want to be ripped and lean year round. It is here that many will reach for these types of foods when enjoying a cheat meal or day. It is here however that if you delve too often, you will find frustration in not being able to achieve the body fat levels you are after.

The starchy carbs are the ones we perceive as generally ‚Äúhealthier‚Äù but can still present hardship if we overeat them. These are the oats, grains, pastas, breads, etc. This is the area that I believe we need to learn how to include in our meal plans and put to work fueling our bodies and muscles if we want to see the best results not to mention long term sustainability. 

Beyond the identification of the types of carbs however we need to employ additional strategies to keep them helping us and not hurting our fat loss efforts. Learn the composition of the carbohydrates you are eating. Aim for carbs that provide no more than 10-20 percent of their total carbs from sugars. This information is easily available online. 

Watch the video I have on dividing your plate for success and entertain the idea of a low fat diet as an alternative to low carb eating for a more sustainable plan.

And lastly, don‚Äôt forget to train with weights to compliment your diet to lose fat. Building lean muscle is always going to help you in your efforts to lose body fat. The more lean muscle you have the more storage capacity you have for blood glucose in the form of muscle glycogen. 

The bottom line is, if you are looking for how to lose fat and want a step by step plan for getting it done permanently, you need a complete plan with workouts and meal plans laid out for you day by day. Those are all available for you at athleanx.com via the link below.

Lyrics:
Had to do maybach 
I can‚Äôt do a regular Benz 
I like the seats that recline 
Know I‚Äôm dog 
Yes I‚Äôm fuckin her and her friend 
I like em two at a time 
And She wanna slide she pull out her insta and shit
She go if she fuck up the vibe 
How am I 23 sittin on 23 I feel like Jordan 
I‚Äôm back in my prime (2x)

This years in the makin shit why would I lie 
Dreamed of the whip now I don‚Äôt even drive 
I got a chauffeur 
She told me I‚Äôm drivin her crazy 
She hate what I‚Äôm doin online 
10 in a week and I‚Äôm just not suprised
I had to take that one home to the guys 
I got the feds watchin 
Haters watchin 
News watchin that‚Äôs a whole lotta eyes 
I went and Flooded my wrist 
For the fuck of this shit 

While these rappers just run out of time 
I‚Äôm here forever 
This lives televised 
Ain‚Äôt no way they could take none from any of mine 
That boy a vette 
And he still on the rise 
Rolls or the Bentley shit I can‚Äôt decide 
I got the paparazzi at the front of my door 
I can‚Äôt leave shit I need a disguise

Had to do maybach 
I can‚Äôt do a regular Benz 
I like the seats that recline 
Know I‚Äôm dog 
Yes I‚Äôm fuckin her and her friend 
I like em two at a time 
And She wanna slide she pull out her insta and shit
She go if she fuck up the vibe 
How am I 23 sittin on 23 I feel like Jordan 
I‚Äôm back in my prime (2x)"

I ride huge dirt jumps in Germany on my downhill MTB with the best riders in the world before shredding freeride lines in the quarry, would you ride this trail? 

My second video from this years Audi Nines event is a banger as I shred the huge freeride line on my downhill bike which snakes its way down through this huge quarry in the middle of Germany. The event last a week and the aim is create the best content we can with a selection of amazing photographers and filmers at our disposal. Today mission was basically just to have fun on these massive dirt jumps and do trains with all the other riders. The whole video was shot using GoPro and this is perfect for really getting a good view of the trails we were riding. After shredding the DH bike we switch to the Haibike electric bike and smash some laps of the crazy steep freeride lines that are dotted around the outside of the quarry. It was so fun to switch over on to the E-bike because they are just so easy for blasting around on, so dreamy! As the day ends we get to watch a worlds first trick happen from the French shredder Paul Couderc. He is lifted in to the air on a huge crane before flipping his way off this crazy setup, but will it work?? 

I hope you enjoy the video!

With all the air pressure differences, turbulence and Flow, I have always wondered what was going on inside the intake manifold when I was driving around especially on a turbocharged car where you have boost pressure, the sound of the engine running from inside the manifold was surreal.

I will be rigging and mounting cameras in all sorts of unusual places to give us a unique perspective and understanding of how things work, so don't forget to subscribe and hit that Bell!.

Well gals and guys, this is it. This is the end of the epic saga of the 350z builds. We finally figure out if more expensive means more better. Is Hi Car actually faster than Low Car?

Today is a super exciting nw project, I've NEVER seen anyone do this before, Jackie from NerdEcrafter and I have decided to try customizing plushies for the first time. This is a lot like squishy makeovers, but with plushies instead!

Since this has never been done before, we are having to get very experimental. I ended up using a combination of techniques and materials to give my plushie a makeover. I will be doing some basic sewing, gluing, using felt, ribbon, and lots of fabric paint as usual! We decided to us Squishmallows to customize since they are so simple and really cute. Get ready for some cute plushie creations üòä

___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________

Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL). 

CURRENT SERIES:
Squishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewers
Thrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard sales
Bake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real life
Create This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)
Squishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewers
Craft Kit Testing: pretty self explanatory. testing craft kits.

this was a viewer request to try and run the see-through engine on black powder or gunpowder.
I first had to rig up the engine and build some sort of delivery system to introduce the black powder into the engine while I was running, it was quite a challenge to actually get it to work, originally I attempted but it did not work and then I figured out a better solution which I show in this video.

 I got it to work and the results were spectacular, hopefully you enjoy the video and please tell me what you think in the comments below.

For 2021 he replaces Sergio Perez, and will slot in alongside Lance Stroll. It's a marquee signing for the team's Aston rebrand next year, and gives it a world champion driver at a time when it wants to take the next step up to becoming a race-winning team. But is success for this partnership a slam dunk? In this video, Scott Mitchell looks at the risks on both sides, as Vettel hopes the team can build some real upward momentum, Racing Point banks on getting the fired-up version of Vettel, and we take a moment to spare a thought for Perez for being left on the sidelines by a team he has played a pivotal role with for many years.

Check it out here: https://anchor.fm/thefinesthalfhour

Bartolom√© de las Casas had it all. A conquistador at the height of Spain's power, he had earned an encomendia for helping take over the island of Cuba. This gave him rights to land... and the enslaved indigenous people on the land. Bartolom√© thought nothing of it. Even when he became the first Catholic priest ordained in the Americas, he continued to turn a blind eye to the suffering of conquered peoples. But in 1514, a particular scripture passage would flip his world view upside down and turn Bartolom√© de las Casas into one of the first human rights activists.

No, it was not.
The utter lack of care and direction regarding the sequel trilogy has me beyond bothered. I found it hard to find my words in this first time reaction and realization that we've really truly been all lied to regarding everything.

The Mandalorian is all I have to look forward to.
With Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni behind Star Wars, there is hope. As far as the sequels go, they're no longer in my timeline of Star Wars canon.

I don't think the actors should ever be to blame. Neither should the writers and directors. You can't expect them to understand Star Wars. The higher ups who sign off on such a thing, especially when appointed by George Lucas like KK was, should have put her foot down and really course corrected things.

Everything is so messed up, and the final nail is in.
I hope things continue under Favreau. He is a new hope.

Lewis Hamilton says he takes full responsibility for entering the pitlane whilst it was closed during the Italian Grand Prix, an error which resulted in a 10-second time penalty for the Mercedes driver. Hamilton eventually finished in 7th, and congratulated race winner Pierre Gasly as he passed by during this interview.

Check out https://aatishb.com/maskmath to explore and for references.

This video is about how masks (whether surgical, or N95, or cloth) are counterintuitive and actually work much better epidemiologically than one might expect. Masks do double-duty, and the fraction of interactions with masks is much higher than the fraction of people wearing masks, so partially adopted, partially effective masks are able to reduce the basic reproduction number surprisingly well.
