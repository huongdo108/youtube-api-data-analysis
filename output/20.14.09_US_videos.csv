Hundreds of thousands of fans — dressed in their Sunday’s best — of the living legends tuned into Instagram Live for the “Master class we’ve all been waiting for.” 

#PattiLaBelle #GladysKnight #Verzuz

The virtual audience included everyone from Former First Lady Michelle Obama, Oprah Winfrey, Tyrese, Swizz Beatz — who was also celebrating his birthday, Timbaland, Queen Latifah, Brandy and so many more.

And while there were no Gladys Knight’s chicken and waffles or Pattie LaBelle pies, the Ciroc was definitely flowing, which fostered a festive vibe for viewers.

THE THINGS YOU'LL NEED:
Funfetti Cake
• 2 cups flour
• 2 teaspoons baking powder
• 1/8 teaspoon salt
• 1 stick salted butter, at room temperature
• ¼ cup coconut oil
• 1 ½ cups sugar
• 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
• ¼ teaspoon almond extract
• 5 large egg whites, at room temperature
• ¾ cup whole milk
• ¼ cup sprinkles


I had so much fun #Trying #Baking a #Cake in a Crock Pot Slow Cooker for the first time ever! I can't believe how well this worked after a little trial and error. I tested it a bunch of different ways and this is the one that worked the best. I've also started to test bake other recipes in my slow cooker like brownies and other fun desserts!

Today is a super exciting nw project, I've NEVER seen anyone do this before, Jackie from NerdEcrafter and I have decided to try customizing plushies for the first time. This is a lot like squishy makeovers, but with plushies instead!

Since this has never been done before, we are having to get very experimental. I ended up using a combination of techniques and materials to give my plushie a makeover. I will be doing some basic sewing, gluing, using felt, ribbon, and lots of fabric paint as usual! We decided to us Squishmallows to customize since they are so simple and really cute. Get ready for some cute plushie creations 😊

___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________

Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL). 

CURRENT SERIES:
Squishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewers
Thrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard sales
Bake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real life

My massive colony of fire ants (Phoenix Empire) are moving into their new Avatar-themed floating mountains paludarium, called the Ember Islands. I need to plan the emigration properly so to make it as sooth as possible for the ants and the queen. What I observed during the move was incredible and an experience I'll never forget. Ant love forever! This video was shot in 4K Ultra HD resolution. #FireAnts #FloatingMountains #AntFarm

Lyrics:
Had to do maybach 
I can’t do a regular Benz 
I like the seats that recline 
Know I’m dog 
Yes I’m fuckin her and her friend 
I like em two at a time 
And She wanna slide she pull out her insta and shit
She go if she fuck up the vibe 
How am I 23 sittin on 23 I feel like Jordan 
I’m back in my prime (2x)

This years in the makin shit why would I lie 
Dreamed of the whip now I don’t even drive 
I got a chauffeur 
She told me I’m drivin her crazy 
She hate what I’m doin online 
10 in a week and I’m just not suprised
I had to take that one home to the guys 
I got the feds watchin 
Haters watchin 
News watchin that’s a whole lotta eyes 
I went and Flooded my wrist 
For the fuck of this shit 

While these rappers just run out of time 
I’m here forever 
This lives televised 
Ain’t no way they could take none from any of mine 
That boy a vette 
And he still on the rise 
Rolls or the Bentley shit I can’t decide 
I got the paparazzi at the front of my door 
I can’t leave shit I need a disguise

Had to do maybach 
I can’t do a regular Benz 
I like the seats that recline 
Know I’m dog 
Yes I’m fuckin her and her friend 
I like em two at a time 
And She wanna slide she pull out her insta and shit
She go if she fuck up the vibe 
How am I 23 sittin on 23 I feel like Jordan 
I’m back in my prime (2x)"

As I currently don't know what to restore next, I decided to make the 8 ball. It was a very cool little project. Very accurate work was needed to get all six individual pieces fit together with no gaps. The hardest part of this project was filming the last few shots, because it is so super shiny now and reflects everything. I really like how it turned out and it will be a nice decoration piece to look at.

I hope you like my work and the video.

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be haunted by Colonel Sanders? What could make such a thing a reality? That's where today's theory starts! You see in Japan KFC is HUGELY popular, so much that there are even statues of the Colonel himself. Would you believe that one of those statues is responsible for a CURSE put on a Japanese baseball team? Theorists, this is about to get WEIRD!

Oscar  nominee  Denis  Villeneuve  (“Arrival,”  “Blade  Runner  2049”)  directs  Warner  Bros.  Pictures  and  Legendary Pictures’ “Dune,” the big-screen adaptation of Frank Herbert’s seminal bestseller of the same name. A mythic and emotionally charged hero’s journey, “Dune” tells the story of Paul Atreides, a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding, who must travel to the most dangerous planet  in  the  universe  to  ensure  the  future  of  his  family  and  his  people.  As  malevolent  forces  explode  into conflict over the planet’s exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence—a commodity capable of unlocking humanity’s greatest potential—only those who can conquer their fear will survive.The film stars Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet (“Call Me by Your Name,”  “Little Women”), Rebecca Ferguson  (“Stephen  King’s  Doctor  Sleep,”   “Mission:  Impossible  –  Fallout”),  Oscar  Isaac  (the “Star  Wars” franchise) Oscar nominee Josh Brolin (“Milk,” “Avengers: Infinity War”), Stellan Skarsgård (HBO’s “Chernobyl,” “Avengers: Age of Ultron”), Dave Bautista (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “Avengers: Endgame”), Stephen McKinley Henderson (“Fences,” “Lady Bird”), Zendaya (“Spider-Man: Homecoming,” HBO’s “Euphoria”), Chang Chen (“Mr.  Long,” “Crouching  Tiger,  Hidden  Dragon”),    David  Dastmalchian  (“Blade  Runner  2049,”  “The  Dark  Knight”), Sharon  Duncan-Brewster  (“Rogue  One:  A  Star  Wars  Story,”  Netflix’s “Sex  Education”),   with  Oscar  nominee Charlotte Rampling (“45 Years,” “Assassin’s Creed”), with Jason Momoa (“Aquaman,” HBO’s “Game of Thrones”), and Oscar winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men,” “Skyfall”).   Villeneuve directed “Dune” from a screenplay he co-wrote with Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth based on the novel of the same name written by Frank Herbert.  Villeneuve also produced the film with Mary Parent, Cale Boyter  and  Joe  Caracciolo,  Jr.   The  executive  producers  are  Tanya  Lapointe,  Joshua  Grode,  Herbert  W.  Gains, Jon Spaihts, Thomas Tull, Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt and Kim Herbert. Behind  the  scenes,  Villeneuve  reteamed  with  two-time  Oscar-nominated  production  designer  Patrice  Vermette  (“Arrival,”  “Sicario,”  “The  Young  Victoria”),  two-time  Oscar-nominated  editor  Joe  Walker  (“Blade  Runner  2049,”  “Arrival,”  “12  Years  a  Slave”),  two-time  Oscar-winning  visual  effects  supervisor  Paul  Lambert  (“First Man,” “Blade Runner 2049”), and Oscar-winning special effects supervisor Gerd Nefzer (“Blade Runner 2049”).    He  also  collaborated  for  the  first  time  with  Oscar-nominated  director  of  photography  Greig  Fraser  (“Lion,”  “Zero  Dark  Thirty,”  “Rogue  One:  A  Star  Wars  Story”);  three-time  Oscar-nominated  costume  designer  
Jacqueline West (“The Revenant,” “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” “Quills”) and co-costume designer Bob Morgan; and stunt coordinator Tom Struthers (“The Dark Knight” trilogy, “Inception”).  Oscar-winning and multiple  Oscar-nominated  composer  Hans  Zimmer  (“Blade  Runner  2049,”  “Inception,”  “Gladiator,”  “The  Lion King”) is creating the score.  Warner  Bros.  Pictures  and  Legendary  Pictures  Present  “Dune.”    The  film  is  slated  to  be  released  in  theaters on December 18, 2020."

Hope For The Day (HFTD) is a non-profit movement empowering the conversation on proactive suicide prevention and mental health education. Join the Proactive Suicide Prevention conversation at http://www.hftd.org 

Suicide Prevention starts with a conversation we're not having with our mental health due to Stigma. The first step to breaking that silence is dispelling stigmas of fear, judgement, and shame about our internal experiences. We achieve that by proclaiming It's Ok Not To Be Ok!

Lyrics:
Feeling like a drop in the ocean that don’t nobody notice
Maybe it’s all just in your head
Feeling like you’re trapped in your own skin, and now your body’s frozen
Broken down, you’ve got nothing left
When you’re high on emotion and you’re losing your focus and you feel too exhausted to pray
Don’t get lost in the moment or give up when you’re closest, all you need is somebody to say
It’s okay not to be okay
It’s okay not to be okay
When you’re down and you feel ashamed
It’s okay not to be okay
Feeling like your life’s an illusion and lately you’re secluded
Thinking you’ll never get your chance
Feeling like you got no solution, it’s only ‘cause you’re human
No control its out of your hands 
When you’re high on emotion and you’re losing your focus and you feel too exhausted to pray
Don’t get lost in the moment or give up when you’re closest, all you need is somebody to say
It’s okay not to be okay
It’s okay not to be okay
When you’re down and you feel ashamed
It’s okay not to be okay
When you’re high on emotion and you’re losing your focus and you feel too exhausted to pray
Don’t get lost in the moment or give up when you’re closest, all you need is somebody to say
It’s okay not to be okay
It’s okay not to be okay
When you’re down and you feel ashamed
It’s okay not to be okay
It’s okay not to be okay

House of Cards Lyrics 

Ate lunch with the devil was dancing with death
I’m making the most of the chance I have left 
One hand to the sky one hand on my chest , 
If you asked if I’m scared then the answer is yes 
I done been up I don’t been poor 
Not even a dollar I slept on the floor 
A mountain of problems that can’t be ignored
I came from the bottom to settle the score 
Lord gave me a shot with this music 
I promised him no more excuses 
Been trying so hard you can tell by my scars that my past has been so damn abusive 
It’s fine I tell you what the truth is 
Some days I swear I feel useless my happiness has been elusive 
I had an encounter with Judas 
Somewhere in the dark along the line I lost my mind 
The old me is a prisoner that’s somewhere lost in time 
I had family I treated right that tried to take my life 
Look at my back and you want find no room to put another knife 


Chorus

I lost my mind I got no shame and I keep trying not to cry
I’ve got this ice running through my veins and I got fire in my eyes

All the things that I’ve done in the darkness all the nights that my mind was at war
I’m down in my soul there’s one thing I know heaven Ain't a place you go looking for

They all fall down just like a house of cards they all fall down heaven ain't a place you go looking for


Verse 2 
Hold up, hold up pass me the weed and let’s roll up
Been struggling trying to get sober fuck it pass me the drink and let’s pour up
But don’t ask what’s in my Styrofoam
If you can tell the lights are on but there ain’t nobody home
Then blowing this killer shit
You can tell that I’m feeling it
You can tell that I’m really lit 
Out of body experience
Back in my zone back in my bag I ain’t been the same since that happened to dad
I’ve been barefooted while walking on glass surrounded by flames with a can fulla gas 
Ready for war put on my armor
I’m doing this for my son and my daughter
As I kneel down at the foot of my father 
Left all my problems right there at the altar
And he washed away every sin
Now I’m back and I’m better than I ever been


Chorus

I lost my mind I got no shame and I keep trying not to cry
I’ve got this ice running through my veins and I got fire in my eyes

All the things that I’ve done in the darkness all the nights that my mind was at war
I’m down in my soul there’s one thing I know heaven Ain't a place you go looking for

They all fall down just like a house of cards they all fall down heaven ain't a place you go looking for"

I want it all, I don’t care what I gotta` pay
My money is long and yours is short and that’s a shame 
I get another mil staffed in the safe 
I ball hard don’t know it any other way
REMIX!!
Diamante en el cuello
Diamante en el cuello

La cuenta y las chicas aumentando
Nigga nigga
Yo soy a seguir matando
Hasta que dios diga
Empezamo abajo y ahora tamo arriba

¡Jalapeño!, siempre me veo jalapeño
Ponte bruto y sin pensarlo y a tu puta te la preño

No hago fuerza, yo me veo cabron hasta en whitey
Mi nombre ta claro, saben klk con mikey
Mi Flow es bajapanty
Tu eres milloneta sin mover manteca
Soy de los que oro y peca
Sus cadenas son reales, utede` son lo` que son feca
Hasta que dios diga seré un profeta
Y nene dile a wiz kha que prenda una zeta
Diamante en el cuello
Diamante en el cuello

They better off my off days is probably what they hating for and

I can see your boyfriend calling telling me it aint important
You see the corvette outside I’m who they waiting for
They say they want beef aint no problem we get it catered to em`
I want it all, I don’t care what I gotta` pay
My money is long and yours is short and that’s a shame

I ball hard don’t know it any other way

Lyrics:

Yeah 
Ooh Oh Oh 
(Tiempos)
Hasta cuando me tendrás así 
Muriendo por ti (muriendo por ti)
Con estas ganas que quedaron de comernos desde que te vi 
Si no fue suficiente lo que yo ofrecí al menos lo acepté, por eso te perdí 
Quiero remediarlo y esto aquí escribiéndote como un idiota 
Sin saber si estar conmigo te provoca 
Te envió un mensaje así mi mente ya está loca 
Por no tener una respuesta concreta escribiéndote como un idiota 
Sin saber si estar conmigo te provoca 
Te envió un mensaje así mi mente ya está loca 
Por favor contesta

Ey 
Baby dime que tu quieres 
Estar conmigo o con otro que prefieres 
Que yo te llevo a otros niveles
A otros niveles de placeres tuyos 
Dime si no te molesta que te escriba a las 3 de la mañana pensando en ti 
Borracho y loco me tienes 
Dime si no te molesta que te escriba por la noche desvelado pensando en ti 
Borracho y loco me tienes 
Aquí escribiéndote como un idiota sin saber si estar conmigo te provoca 
Te envió un mensaje así mi mente ya está loca 
Por no tener una respuesta concreta escribiéndote como un idiota 
Sin saber si estar conmigo te provoca 
Te envió un mensaje así mi mente ya está loca por favor contesta

Ey 
Te digo que quiero, me dejas en visto 
Vamos a ver que pasa si yo te desvisto 
No me respondas simplemente llégale 
Que estoy esperándote 
Te digo que quiero, me dejas en visto 
Vamos a ver qué pasa si yo te desvisto 
No me respondas simplemente llégale 
Aquí escribiéndote como un idiota sin saber si estar conmigo te provoca 
Te envió un mensaje así mi mente ya está loca 
Por no tener una respuesta concreta escribiéndote como un idiota 
Sin saber si estar conmigo te provoca 
Te envió un mensaje así mi mente ya está loca 
Por favor contesta

We check out different environments, blocks and colors in Minecraft to see how much they change when I wear the colorblind glasses. I also took a colorblind test before and after to see if the colorblind glasses actually made a difference! This was a crazy experience."

Letra:

Como la luna solo sale cuando sale cuando se va el sol
Nadie la amarra ella lo que quiere es bacilon
No le falta ropa nueva se pasa en el mall
Y ese booty no le cabe en el pantalón
Oh oh
Ninguna a ella se compara
Frontea mami que tu eres la para
Cartera y Zapatilla Cara
Tu sabe papi que yo soy la para
Ninguna a ella se compara
Frontea mami que tu eres la para
Vainita Fendy y balenciaga
Frontea papi que yo soy la para
La movie en high
Te gusta asi
De nineteen forty two a X o Hennesy
Yo con la Louis Vuitton y tu con la Gucci
No fuma marihuana pero Hookah si
Baby tu eres el final
Tienes vuelto locos a to’ los tiguerones
Pero yo soy el único que te lo pone
Hasta los talones te lambo
Saque pal de pesos del banco
Si quieres nos vamos a una villa para las terrenas o casa de campo
Papi ven a buscarme que ya yo estoy ready
Me di par de tragos aquí pensando en ti
Contigo baby yo siempre la paso jevi
Tu ta clara que eres la que manda aquí
Ninguna a ella se compara
Frontea mami que tu eres la para
Cartera y Zapatilla Cara
Tu sabe papi que yo soy la para
Ninguna a ella se compara
Frontea mami que tu eres la para
Vainita Fendi y balenciaga
Frontea papi que yo soy la para

Siempre suela roja en los tacones
Parece que soy modelo de la Louis Vouttin
De victoria yo tengo todas las colecciones
Baby me la pongo solamente para ti
Y nos vivimos la peli bebiendo don peri
Estaba en el mall y te compre una combi burberry
Vamos a gastar no le pare
Yo soy la mami del swagger
No hacemos coro con guare
Diles a todas esas chapis que no se comparen
Yeah
Papi ven a buscarme que ya yo estoy ready
Me di par de tragos aquí pensando en ti
Contigo baby yo siempre la paso jevi
Tu ta clara que eres la que manda aquí
Ninguna a ella se compara
Frontea mami que tu eres la para
Cartera y Zapatilla Cara
Tu sabe papi que yo soy la para
Ninguna a ella se compara

https://www.freaky.movie

This November, on Friday the 13th, prepare to get Freaky with a twisted take on the body-swap movie when a teenage girl switches bodies with a relentless serial killer.  

Seventeen-year-old Millie Kessler (Kathryn Newton, Blockers, HBO’s Big Little Lies) is just trying to survive the bloodthirsty halls of Blissfield High and the cruelty of the popular crowd. But when she becomes the newest target of The Butcher (Vince Vaughn), her town’s infamous serial killer, her senior year becomes the least of her worries. 

When The Butcher’s mystical ancient dagger causes him and Millie to wake up in each other’s bodies, Millie learns that she has just 24 hours to get her body back before the switch becomes permanent and she’s trapped in the form of a middle-aged maniac forever. The only problem is she now looks like a towering psychopath who’s the target of a city-wide manhunt while The Butcher looks like her and has brought his appetite for carnage to Homecoming.

With some help from her friends—ultra-woke Nyla (Celeste O’Connor, Ghostbusters: Afterlife), ultra-fabulous Joshua (Misha Osherovich, The Goldfinch) and her crush Booker (Uriah Shelton, Enter the Warriors Gate)—Millie races against the clock to reverse the curse while The Butcher discovers that having a female teen body is the perfect cover for a little Homecoming killing spree. 

The film also stars Alan Ruck (HBO’s Succession), Katie Finneran (TV’s Why Women Kill) and Dana Drori (Hulu’s High Fidelity). 

From the deliciously debased mind of writer-director Christopher Landon (Happy Death Day, the Paranormal Activity franchise) comes a pitch-black horror-comedy about a slasher, a senior, and the brutal truth about high school.  

Freaky is written by Christopher Landon and Michael Kennedy (Fox’s Bordertown) and is produced by Jason Blum (Halloween, The Invisible Man). The film is produced by Blumhouse Productions in association with Divide/Conquer. The executive producers are Couper Samuelson and Jeanette Volturno."

The track, a fusion of dancehall, afrobeats and EDM sounds which takes lyrical inspiration from reggae classics by Black Uhuru and Baby Cham, is the first single from Mr Eazi’s Something Else EP out in October.

“This record was really fun to make,” Mr Eazi says, “and it’s crazy how it went from hearing a K4mo intro in the studio with Fred Again, to me jumping on it and then Diplo hopping in! And Walshy hitting me up to say it’s a banger—next thing Nicki is on it! Been a journey really, like two years in the making and I can’t wait to perform it at my next festival!”

Lyrics 

Knock knock
Guess who’s coming to dinner?
Fred, Mr Eazi, Major Lazer inna beamer

Oh my gawd
I’ve never seen a bottom like this
See the way she hula-hoop
Come and jump on like this
See the junk in the trunk
I had to bag her right quick
Feel like magic all together
Multiplied by six

Oh my gawd
I’ve never seen a bottom like this
See the way she hula-hoop
Come and jump on like this
See the junk in the trunk
I had to bag her right quick
Feel like magic all together
All together by six

She say she got a partner
Me I got one

But me wan’ tap
What a conundrum

Never seen a girl wey give me vibes suh
Never seen a girl with biggie bum-bum

You know me got a lot of girls around me
Steady give them love give them the honey
And that is why they love to love to love me
(Ay-ya-ya-ya)

Knock knock
Guess who’s coming to dinner?
Fred, Mr Eazi, Major Lazer inna beamer
Guess who’s coming to dinner?

And I’ma give you whatever you want
So baby come give me some love

Head ah mash-up, becuz my pum pum tun up
And if I’m with my Barbie dolls you know the whole crew done up
Yeah, we done up and plus the pum pum tun up (turned up)

Ride it like a bad gyal, face of an angel
This one here ah major, UK out to Asia
Pull out in da Range, got’em beepin’ like a pager

You know say I’ma give you want (want)
You know I got a body, you can flaunt (flaunt)
You let me come first, I’m in the front
He like kickin’ it with Chun, I’ma diss him when I’m done
‘Cause I’m back in my bag
Throw your rag, throw your flag
And I’m runnin’ up a tab, ‘cause I love poppin’ tags
Got moscato in my cup, poppin’ bottles in the club
He said “Knock, knock?” I said “Who’s that?”

Lyrics:

Yo no te estaba buscando babe 
Pero cuando coincidimos bebe
Fue una cosa que yo no se
Tu fuiste conquistándome 
Y en tus ojos yo lo note 
Que tú quieras y yo también 
Entre botellas de rose 
Nos fuimos calentando 
Tu man me escribió
Y me dijo a mi
Que le gustaban todas mis canciones 
Y yo le dije ay dios mío 
Que rico dios mío 
Luego me dijo
Que le guste yo 
Que conmigo quiere tener relaciones eh 
Y yo le dije
Ay dios mío 
Que rico dios mío 
Ay dios mío 
Que rico dios mío 
Ay dios mío 
Que rico dios mío 
Ay dios mío 
Que rico
Ay dios mío 
Que rico
El me jalo y me dijo ven pa ca 
Yo le dije lento y me hizo tra tra 
Yo se que lo noto y no pude evitar
Dejar de mirarlo y me hizo 
El me invito a salir a bailar 
Un perreito de esos bien anormal
Cuando me fui el me mando a buscar y yo no pude no decirle que no 
Tu man me escribió
Y me dijo a mi
Que le gustaban todas mis canciones 
Y yo le dije ay dios mío 
Que rico dios mío 
Luego me dijo
Que le guste yo 
Que conmigo quiere tener relaciones eh 
Y yo le dije
Ay dios mío 
Que rico dios mío 
Ay dios mío 
Que rico dios mío 
Ay dios mío 
Que rico dios mío 
Ay dios mío 
Que rico
Ay dios mío 
Que rico
El me invito a salir a bailar 
Un perreito de esos bien anormal
Cuando me fui el me mando a buscar y yo no pude no decirle que no 
no pude no decirle que no
no pude no decirle que no
Ay dios mío 
Que rico dios mío 
El man me escribió
Y me dijo a mi
Que le gustaban todas mis canciones Eh
Y yo le dije ay dios mío 
Que rico dios mío 
Luego me dijo
Que le guste yo 
Que conmigo quiere tener relaciones eh 
Y yo le dije
Ay dios mío 
Que rico dios mío
Y yo le dije 
Ay dios mío 
Que rico dios mío 
Ay dios mío

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke. "

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

For her Tiny Desk (home) concert, Phoebe Bridgers chose the White House. OK, maybe it's a green screen, but she and her team created a sweet mock-up of the Oval Office, with Phoebe performing behind a very special desk. It's a far cry from the hotel bed in Austin we first filmed Phoebe on back in 2017, but her ambitions and talent run high. She played the Tiny Desk later that year and returned with newfound bandmates, Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker, as boygenius one year later. But there was more to come when she surprised us all for a magical collaboration with her musical hero Conor Oberst as Better Oblivion Community Center just six months later.

Phoebe and bandmates Marshall Vore on drums and Harrison Whitford on guitar perform three songs from her brilliant new album, Punisher. They open with  Kyoto,  a story song based on her first trip to Japan, followed with a sweet version of  Moon Song  and the sad details of loving someone who doesn't love themself. And then comes the kicker, as Phoebe introduces herself with the words  I hope everybody's enjoying their apocalypse,  as the band kicks into her surreal doomsday tune  I Know the End.  And what an end it is: The trio expands to an ensemble and a crowd-sourced chorus of fans — recording from bedrooms, cars, backyards and trampolines — lets out the kind of cathartic scream that has come to define 2020 for so many of us.

Phoebe for President, 2020.

Lyrics:
 
’Neath a crowd of mongrel trees
I pulled that bothersome thread
Got down on my knees
Grabbed my pen and bowed my head
Tried to summon all that my heart finds true
And send it in my letter to you
 
Things I found out through hard times and good
I wrote ’em all out in ink and blood
Dug deep in my soul and signed my name true
And sent it in my letter to you
 
In my letter to you
I took all my fears and doubts
In my letter to you
All the hard things I found out
In my letter to you
All that I’ve found true
And I sent it in my letter to you
 
I took all the sunshine and rain
All my happiness and all my pain
The dark evening stars
And the morning sky of blue
And I sent it in my letter to you
And I sent it in my letter to you
 
In my letter to you
I took all my fears and doubts
In my letter to you
All the hard things that I found out
In my letter to you
All that I found true
And I sent it in my letter to you
I sent it in my letter to you

No, it was not.
The utter lack of care and direction regarding the sequel trilogy has me beyond bothered. I found it hard to find my words in this first time reaction and realization that we've really truly been all lied to regarding everything.

The Mandalorian is all I have to look forward to.
With Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni behind Star Wars, there is hope. As far as the sequels go, they're no longer in my timeline of Star Wars canon.

I don't think the actors should ever be to blame. Neither should the writers and directors. You can't expect them to understand Star Wars. The higher ups who sign off on such a thing, especially when appointed by George Lucas like KK was, should have put her foot down and really course corrected things.

Everything is so messed up, and the final nail is in.
I hope things continue under Favreau. He is a new hope.

Thousands have told me that anyone can easily miss my first automatic basketball hoop by missing the hoop entirely. That is a really good point and something that I can't let stand. In this video I show you how I devoted several weeks of my life to realizing a basketball hoop that makes your shot go in even if you totally miss the hoop.... it was a lot of fun, and quite a bit more challenging than I was anticipating. Hopefully you enjoy it :)

Although very fun, these videos are very time consuming and expensive. Please consider helping to support the development of these projects through my patreon at http://patreon.com/stuffmadehere

This project was really hard. It was a huge challenge to whittle the 450gigs of footage down into a video that shared my journey of designing and getting this machine working. I hope you enjoyed it :) If you are interested in helping to support me making more of these videos you can check out my Patreon at http://patreon.com/stuffmadehere. One question - would a podcast be interesting yes / no? I've been considering that as an opportunity to share more details and whatnot that can't make it into my videos."

This, as six homes, vehicles, sheds, three shops and farming equipment were destroyed after a wild brush fire in Graham. Governor Inslee has pledged to help hard hit counties. 

Meanwhile, Seattle police said they arrested 22 people during the initial confrontation and confiscated some unexploded Molotov cocktails.

Lyrics:

Verse:
Well, you were the aftermath
Of every judgment
So cold by the sweat that
You’ll waste away
And you carry your enemies
But they’re so familiar
I’m sick of the company
So I cull the shame

Chorus:
And I know you’ll say how I’m a burden
Yeah, do your worst, all at once
I know what you want from me (from me)
I know what you’re thinking
And it’s not the voice of all the others
You’ve only said it to yourself
I know what you want from me (from me)
I know what you’re thinking
Narrator: (They come to feel like things we’re saying to ourselves.)

Verse:
An inch from my ears again:
“You should be sorry,”
A solemn man:
“A better song could fix my problems”
I’m tired of your questioning
You’re cut down too easily
And I don’t know what’s good for me
I can’t decide

Chorus:
And I know you’ll say how I’m a burden
Yeah, do your worst, all at once
I know what you want from me (from me)
I know what you’re thinking
And though they sound like one another
You’ve only said it to yourself
I know what you want from me (from me)
I know what you’re thinking
Narrator: “Now these voices have become our own.”

Verse:
An inch from my ears again:
“You should be sorry,”
A solemn man:
“A better song could fix my problems”
I’m tired of your questioning
You’re cut down too easily
And I don’t know what’s good for me
I can’t decide

Chorus:
And I know you’ll say how I’m a burden
Yeah, do your worst, all at once
I know what you want from me (from me)
I know what you’re thinking
And it’s not the voice of all the others
You’ve only said it to yourself
I know what you want from me (from me)
I know what you’re thinking
And I know you’ll say how I’m a burden
Yeah, do your worst, all at once
I know what you want from me (from me)
I know what you’re thinking
And though they sound like one another
You’ve only said it to yourself
I know what you want from me (from me)
I know what you’re thinking

Narrator:
Sometimes, the inner voice is encouraging: Calling for you to run those final few yards;
You’re nearly there, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going. It will all be OK in
the end.

For 2021 he replaces Sergio Perez, and will slot in alongside Lance Stroll. It's a marquee signing for the team's Aston rebrand next year, and gives it a world champion driver at a time when it wants to take the next step up to becoming a race-winning team. But is success for this partnership a slam dunk? In this video, Scott Mitchell looks at the risks on both sides, as Vettel hopes the team can build some real upward momentum, Racing Point banks on getting the fired-up version of Vettel, and we take a moment to spare a thought for Perez for being left on the sidelines by a team he has played a pivotal role with for many years.

Lyrics
Let's get it
 
Ohhhhhh......
Savage Love
Derulo  

If I woke up without you
I don't know what I would do
Thought I could be single forever 'till I met you
Usually don't be fallin', be fallin' fast
You gotta way of keeping me comin' back-to-back
I just found out the only reason that you lovin' me
Was to get back at your ex lover, but before you leave
Usually I would never, would never even care
Baby I know she creepin', I feel it in the air
 
Every night and every day
I try to make you stay
But your...

Savage love
Did somebody, did somebody
Break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel
But your savage love
When you kiss me
I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that
Your savage love
Your savage la-la-love
Your savage la-la-love
You could use me
Cuz I still want that... (your savage)
 
Baby I hope this ain't karma cuz I get around
You wanna run it up, I wanna lock it down
Usually don't be fallin', be fallin' fallin' fast
You gotta way of making me spend up all my cash
Every night and every day
I try to make you stay
But your...
 
Savage love
Did somebody, did somebody
Break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel
But your savage love
But when you kiss me
I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that
Your savage love
Your savage la-la-love
Your savage la-la-love
You could use me
Cos I still want that your savage love
 
Your savage la-la-love
Your savage la-la-love
You could use me
Baby...
 
Savage love
Did somebody, did somebody
Break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel
But your savage love
But when you kiss me
I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that

Your savage love (savage love)
Your savage la-la-love
Your savage la-la-love
Girl, you could use me

Cuz I still want that
Your savage love

Check out https://aatishb.com/maskmath to explore and for references.

This video is about how masks (whether surgical, or N95, or cloth) are counterintuitive and actually work much better epidemiologically than one might expect. Masks do double-duty, and the fraction of interactions with masks is much higher than the fraction of people wearing masks, so partially adopted, partially effective masks are able to reduce the basic reproduction number surprisingly well.

Behind the Scenes Video of how we built it: https://youtu.be/E60G3ba4TUA 
⇊  Click below for more links!  ⇊

I have been wanting to build this thing as long as I understood the physics of how it all works.  A super big thanks to David Linderman, Jeremy Fielding, Trent, and David Woodall (the welder).

I realize most people who support Smarter Every Day don't do it for  transactional  reasons, (ie, I'll support Smarter Every Day to get stuff).  I also realized that there is often a mental hurdle that must be crossed before support on Patreon starts.  My thought is that I'd really like to give folks a baseball, and it might provide enough momentum to get over that initial hurdle.  I signed the first shipment of baseballs I received, but I only have so many of those.  There's no implication that my signature is worth anything.... it's just kind of what you do with baseballs... it's a tradition.  After a certain number, it will transition to unsigned baseballs.  I've got enough signed baseballs to over all existing Patrons, and many more, but I will wait a month or so to see how many I need to get, then I'll order the second batch.  I like to support jobs and pay people for what they're good at.  The machinists and welders who made the parts in this video for example.  The whole intent here is to diversify away from solely being ad sponsored so I don't have to answer to anyone but myself and Patrons with respect to the types of content I choose to make.  Thank you for understanding what I'm doing here, and even if you decide not to kick in at https://www.patreon.com/smartereveryday , I'm super grateful you took the time to watch this video!  
Thank you very much, 

Destin

When I was younger, my favorite baseball players were Cal Ripken Jr. and Nolan Ryan https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Ryan

Nolan Ryan's fastball has been beat, but when adjusted for radar gun placement it may still be the fastest pitch ever:

👁 ABOUT THIS VIDEO : This is the NEW Rolls Royce Ghost! The new 2021 Ghost is the most technologically advanced Rolls-Royce yet. It succeeds the most successful product in the marque’s 116-year history. Built on an aluminium Rolls-Royce architecture the new Ghost now has all-wheel drive and all-wheel steering for unprecedented agility. It also features the world's first 'Planar' suspension system that significantly increases agility and effortlessness. The new Rolls Royce Ghost is fitted with an upgraded 6.75-litre twin-turbo V12 engine, delivering 571PS and 850nm! A new signature feature of the new Ghost is the down lit Pantheon grille discreetly illuminating the facia of the car.

Apologies for the long absence, but we are trying to get things back on track. No, this video didn’t take us 3 months to make - we filmed a bunch of videos in July and this is the first of them to be released! It’s not a magnum opus, just supposed to be fun and lighthearted. If you want to read more about our plans, you can check out my blog post here:

Now, onto the video! A few weeks ago, somewhere deep in a visual ASMR YouTube rabbit hole, I discovered the online acrylic pour art community - where people essentially make interesting color combos of paint in a cup, then pour that cup onto a canvas or object - and then manipulate that object to create truly mesmerizing, rainbow, psychedelic pieces of art. And I was instantly hooked - just something about the way the paints flow from the cup and then slide around the canvas really got me, ya know? So I decided to pick an acrylic pour art video and try to follow it myself, to see if I could do it too. So I chose a  pouring guru , Tiktus color art, and got to work.

What do you guys think of my ~acrylic pouring adventure~?
