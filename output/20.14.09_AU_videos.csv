Oscar  nominee  Denis  Villeneuve  (“Arrival,”  “Blade  Runner  2049”)  directs  Warner  Bros.  Pictures  and  Legendary Pictures’ “Dune,” the big-screen adaptation of Frank Herbert’s seminal bestseller of the same name. A mythic and emotionally charged hero’s journey, “Dune” tells the story of Paul Atreides, a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding, who must travel to the most dangerous planet  in  the  universe  to  ensure  the  future  of  his  family  and  his  people.  As  malevolent  forces  explode  into conflict over the planet’s exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence—a commodity capable of unlocking humanity’s greatest potential—only those who can conquer their fear will survive.The film stars Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet (“Call Me by Your Name,”  “Little Women”), Rebecca Ferguson  (“Stephen  King’s  Doctor  Sleep,”   “Mission:  Impossible  –  Fallout”),  Oscar  Isaac  (the “Star  Wars” franchise) Oscar nominee Josh Brolin (“Milk,” “Avengers: Infinity War”), Stellan Skarsgård (HBO’s “Chernobyl,” “Avengers: Age of Ultron”), Dave Bautista (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “Avengers: Endgame”), Stephen McKinley Henderson (“Fences,” “Lady Bird”), Zendaya (“Spider-Man: Homecoming,” HBO’s “Euphoria”), Chang Chen (“Mr.  Long,” “Crouching  Tiger,  Hidden  Dragon”),    David  Dastmalchian  (“Blade  Runner  2049,”  “The  Dark  Knight”), Sharon  Duncan-Brewster  (“Rogue  One:  A  Star  Wars  Story,”  Netflix’s “Sex  Education”),   with  Oscar  nominee Charlotte Rampling (“45 Years,” “Assassin’s Creed”), with Jason Momoa (“Aquaman,” HBO’s “Game of Thrones”), and Oscar winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men,” “Skyfall”).   Villeneuve directed “Dune” from a screenplay he co-wrote with Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth based on the novel of the same name written by Frank Herbert.  Villeneuve also produced the film with Mary Parent, Cale Boyter  and  Joe  Caracciolo,  Jr.   The  executive  producers  are  Tanya  Lapointe,  Joshua  Grode,  Herbert  W.  Gains, Jon Spaihts, Thomas Tull, Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt and Kim Herbert. Behind  the  scenes,  Villeneuve  reteamed  with  two-time  Oscar-nominated  production  designer  Patrice  Vermette  (“Arrival,”  “Sicario,”  “The  Young  Victoria”),  two-time  Oscar-nominated  editor  Joe  Walker  (“Blade  Runner  2049,”  “Arrival,”  “12  Years  a  Slave”),  two-time  Oscar-winning  visual  effects  supervisor  Paul  Lambert  (“First Man,” “Blade Runner 2049”), and Oscar-winning special effects supervisor Gerd Nefzer (“Blade Runner 2049”).    He  also  collaborated  for  the  first  time  with  Oscar-nominated  director  of  photography  Greig  Fraser  (“Lion,”  “Zero  Dark  Thirty,”  “Rogue  One:  A  Star  Wars  Story”);  three-time  Oscar-nominated  costume  designer  
Jacqueline West (“The Revenant,” “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” “Quills”) and co-costume designer Bob Morgan; and stunt coordinator Tom Struthers (“The Dark Knight” trilogy, “Inception”).  Oscar-winning and multiple  Oscar-nominated  composer  Hans  Zimmer  (“Blade  Runner  2049,”  “Inception,”  “Gladiator,”  “The  Lion King”) is creating the score.  Warner  Bros.  Pictures  and  Legendary  Pictures  Present  “Dune.”    The  film  is  slated  to  be  released  in  theaters on December 18, 2020."

Lyrics:
Had to do maybach 
I can’t do a regular Benz 
I like the seats that recline 
Know I’m dog 
Yes I’m fuckin her and her friend 
I like em two at a time 
And She wanna slide she pull out her insta and shit
She go if she fuck up the vibe 
How am I 23 sittin on 23 I feel like Jordan 
I’m back in my prime (2x)

This years in the makin shit why would I lie 
Dreamed of the whip now I don’t even drive 
I got a chauffeur 
She told me I’m drivin her crazy 
She hate what I’m doin online 
10 in a week and I’m just not suprised
I had to take that one home to the guys 
I got the feds watchin 
Haters watchin 
News watchin that’s a whole lotta eyes 
I went and Flooded my wrist 
For the fuck of this shit 

While these rappers just run out of time 
I’m here forever 
This lives televised 
Ain’t no way they could take none from any of mine 
That boy a vette 
And he still on the rise 
Rolls or the Bentley shit I can’t decide 
I got the paparazzi at the front of my door 
I can’t leave shit I need a disguise

Had to do maybach 
I can’t do a regular Benz 
I like the seats that recline 
Know I’m dog 
Yes I’m fuckin her and her friend 
I like em two at a time 
And She wanna slide she pull out her insta and shit
She go if she fuck up the vibe 
How am I 23 sittin on 23 I feel like Jordan 
I’m back in my prime (2x)"

Check out Moriah's video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNhebYZurE0 . Moriah's Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/MoriahElizabeth/featured . I'm so happy to be able to work with my friend again. We wanted to make a unique and fun DIY craft that we've never seen being done on youtube before. Much like Squishy Makeovers, this diy project transforms squishmallows into custom dolls. This is the first custom doll plushies I've ever made and they are ooak! I used Tulip fabric paints, acrylic paints, solarcolordust airbrush, and felt...and of course SPRINKLES.
 
@Moriah Elizabeth and I were supposed to have a fun in-person collaboration this summer, but with everything going on, we decided to do this fun idea instead. We went with the idea that we would make one plushie in the style of the other (I would make one sweet and 2 darkness creatures), and she would make (1 darkness, and 2 sweetness). I'm so happy to have creative friends in our community.

The new trailer for The Batman starring Robert Pattinson looks very interesting... and surprisingly familiar? You see, with all of the hints hidden in the newest trailer - and I don't mean the riddles - I think I've figured out the ending twist of this movie! Loyal Theorists, you may be thinking,  Matpat, how can you possibly know off of the trailer?  Never doubt my ability to theorize out of the smallest details! You see, I think the big twist of this movie will be that The Batman is actually... well you'll need to watch to find out!

“Regional Victoria will take one step today, and they will potentially, around the middle of the week, reach those thresholds of less than five cases, a 14-day average. They are at 4.1 cases now per day,” Mr Andrews said.

“I wanted to remind, as part of that safe and steady steps, part of the roadmap, from 11.59pm tonight, so essentially from midnight tonight, Melbourne moves from Stage Four restrictions to the first step of our roadmap which brings small, I fully acknowledge, small changes that allow for more social interaction and more time outside.

“Social bubbles for those living alone or single parents - they will be allowed to have one other person in their home. 

“Exercise is extended for two hours, split over a maximum of two sessions, but that goes obviously from one hour to two hours, and the notion of time outside, time outdoors, whilst at the moment it is just for exercise, it will also now be from midnight tonight for social interaction with one other person or members of your household.

“Of course, as we move towards the warmer months, the curfew is extended from 8:00pm from tomorrow night essentially, from midnight tonight, so apply from Monday night from 8:00pm to 9:00pm, so an extra hour of that freedom of movement.”

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be haunted by Colonel Sanders? What could make such a thing a reality? That's where today's theory starts! You see in Japan KFC is HUGELY popular, so much that there are even statues of the Colonel himself. Would you believe that one of those statues is responsible for a CURSE put on a Japanese baseball team? Theorists, this is about to get WEIRD!

Lyrics
Let's get it
 
Ohhhhhh......
Savage Love
Derulo  

If I woke up without you
I don't know what I would do
Thought I could be single forever 'till I met you
Usually don't be fallin', be fallin' fast
You gotta way of keeping me comin' back-to-back
I just found out the only reason that you lovin' me
Was to get back at your ex lover, but before you leave
Usually I would never, would never even care
Baby I know she creepin', I feel it in the air
 
Every night and every day
I try to make you stay
But your...

Savage love
Did somebody, did somebody
Break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel
But your savage love
When you kiss me
I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that
Your savage love
Your savage la-la-love
Your savage la-la-love
You could use me
Cuz I still want that... (your savage)
 
Baby I hope this ain't karma cuz I get around
You wanna run it up, I wanna lock it down
Usually don't be fallin', be fallin' fallin' fast
You gotta way of making me spend up all my cash
Every night and every day
I try to make you stay
But your...
 
Savage love
Did somebody, did somebody
Break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel
But your savage love
But when you kiss me
I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that
Your savage love
Your savage la-la-love
Your savage la-la-love
You could use me
Cos I still want that your savage love
 
Your savage la-la-love
Your savage la-la-love
You could use me
Baby...
 
Savage love
Did somebody, did somebody
Break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel
But your savage love
But when you kiss me
I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that

Your savage love (savage love)
Your savage la-la-love
Your savage la-la-love
Girl, you could use me

Cuz I still want that
Your savage love

My massive colony of fire ants (Phoenix Empire) are moving into their new Avatar-themed floating mountains paludarium, called the Ember Islands. I need to plan the emigration properly so to make it as sooth as possible for the ants and the queen. What I observed during the move was incredible and an experience I'll never forget. Ant love forever! This video was shot in 4K Ultra HD resolution. #FireAnts #FloatingMountains #AntFarm

As I currently don't know what to restore next, I decided to make the 8 ball. It was a very cool little project. Very accurate work was needed to get all six individual pieces fit together with no gaps. The hardest part of this project was filming the last few shots, because it is so super shiny now and reflects everything. I really like how it turned out and it will be a nice decoration piece to look at.

I hope you like my work and the video.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke. "

In late April 1945, the German 12th Army launched a daring attack at the Soviet forces encircling Berlin in an attempt to create an escape route west for trapped soldiers and civilians. It was the last full-scale German offensive of WWII.

Dr. Mark Felton is a well-known British historian, the author of 22 non-fiction books, including bestsellers 'Zero Night' and 'Castle of the Eagles', both currently being developed into movies in Hollywood. In addition to writing, Mark also appears regularly in television documentaries around the world, including on The History Channel, Netflix, National Geographic, Quest, American Heroes Channel and RMC Decouverte. His books have formed the background to several TV and radio documentaries. More information about Mark can be found at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Felton

THE THINGS YOU'LL NEED:
Funfetti Cake
• 2 cups flour
• 2 teaspoons baking powder
• 1/8 teaspoon salt
• 1 stick salted butter, at room temperature
• ¼ cup coconut oil
• 1 ½ cups sugar
• 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
• ¼ teaspoon almond extract
• 5 large egg whites, at room temperature
• ¾ cup whole milk
• ¼ cup sprinkles


I had so much fun #Trying #Baking a #Cake in a Crock Pot Slow Cooker for the first time ever! I can't believe how well this worked after a little trial and error. I tested it a bunch of different ways and this is the one that worked the best. I've also started to test bake other recipes in my slow cooker like brownies and other fun desserts!

The #CookMyLife Challenge continues! Follow along as the recipe developer and chef Sohla El-Waylly cooks through recipes that define three different moments of her life.

First up, her mom’s Chicken Korma (:29). As a kid, Sohla would pull the meat off the bones and pile it between mayo-slathered white bread to make a chicken korma sandwich — cut on a diagonal, of course.

Then, Halibut Crudo With Citrus Foam (6:26), a recipe that Sohla learned after culinary school while working at an upscale restaurant. It’s “filled with techniques that you’ll never need in real life.”

Last but not least, Fried Chicken With Chile Oil and Spice Dust (10:08), which comes from Hail Mary, the restaurant Sohla started with her husband.

There was a stacked cast of barrel aficionados, and although it was one of the more congested lineups that we've seen this year, the sets were consistent and well stocked.

With the tide moving in during the day we decided to go film the Bombie at Uluwatu - so if you enjoy watching bomb sets and heavy beat-downs, you're going to be stoked with tomorrow night's edit.

Subscribe: http://ab.co/GardeningYouTube 

Like us, microbes need air, water and food. Get that right, and the local microorganisms and insects will soon transform your kitchen and garden waste into rich, healthy, sweet-smelling compost. A handful of compost can contain a billion microorganisms.   

Costa sets up a simple system with two upright plastic compost bins - the ones with no base, although he covers them with some chicken wire to keep out vermin. Simply find a spot that’s out of the way, not in full sun, away from tree roots, and sitting on soil. Ideally you have two bins so, after one has been filled, you can leave it to decompose while you fill the second bin.  

There’s no secret recipe or ‘right or wrong’ to making compost, but it’s important to keep a balance of carbon-rich, brown material (used for energy) and nitrogen-rich greens (used to reproduce and grow). 

Green is the nitrogen-rich fresh material that includes kitchen scraps, grass clippings, fresh weeds, coffee grounds and tea leaves - even chicken feathers and poo.  

Brown material can include dry leaves, straw from animal bedding, wood chips, shredded paper, and ripped-up egg cartons. 

When you’re starting, it’s also best to keep meat, wheat and dairy out, as they can attract vermin. 

Start with a layer of dry carbon material, which has air pocked and allows oxygen to get into the system. Then, every time you add a layer of green material, add a layer of brown on top, and water it in. Costa starts this layering even in his kitchen tidy. 

Rather than laying newspaper flat, rip it into streamers and try to incorporate as much air with it as possible - Costa has a little dance that helps do this…. 

Adding layers gradually like this and then leaving it to decompose is called cold composting. There is also a system that speeds up the process, called hot composting; this requires a larger compost pile, specific brown and green ratios, and regular turning.  

Unless you are running a large, hot-composting heap in excess of 1m3, avoid introducing plants with pests or pathogens (like mildews) or weeds with seed heads or bulbs – these can persist in compost and be spread around the garden via the compost later.  

But, don’t just bin those weeds - you can use them to make a weed tea, a DIY liquid fertiliser that’s good for your garden and your compost heap. 

Whack your weeds into an old pillowcase, hessian bag, or wrap them in shadecloth – the greener and fresher the weeds, the better! Bunging weeds into a bag stops the seeds being spread, and the brew from clogging your watering-can rose. 

Dump this weed ‘tea bag’ into a big bucket of water, cover, and let it sit for a couple of days, stirring when you remember. 

Once your weed tea has steeped, use the tea diluted in a ratio of 1:3 in a watering can and use it to water edible plants such as leafy greens, or pour it on your compost heap to give it a kick along!  

The watered-down weeds can go into your green-waste bin – they’ve served their purpose.

Today is a super exciting nw project, I've NEVER seen anyone do this before, Jackie from NerdEcrafter and I have decided to try customizing plushies for the first time. This is a lot like squishy makeovers, but with plushies instead!

Since this has never been done before, we are having to get very experimental. I ended up using a combination of techniques and materials to give my plushie a makeover. I will be doing some basic sewing, gluing, using felt, ribbon, and lots of fabric paint as usual! We decided to us Squishmallows to customize since they are so simple and really cute. Get ready for some cute plushie creations 😊

___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________

Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL). 

CURRENT SERIES:
Squishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewers

Apologies for the long absence, but we are trying to get things back on track. No, this video didn’t take us 3 months to make - we filmed a bunch of videos in July and this is the first of them to be released! It’s not a magnum opus, just supposed to be fun and lighthearted. If you want to read more about our plans, you can check out my blog post here:

https://www.safiyasnewintrosong.com/single-post/2020/09/04/where-have-we-been

Now, onto the video! A few weeks ago, somewhere deep in a visual ASMR YouTube rabbit hole, I discovered the online acrylic pour art community - where people essentially make interesting color combos of paint in a cup, then pour that cup onto a canvas or object - and then manipulate that object to create truly mesmerizing, rainbow, psychedelic pieces of art. And I was instantly hooked - just something about the way the paints flow from the cup and then slide around the canvas really got me, ya know? So I decided to pick an acrylic pour art video and try to follow it myself, to see if I could do it too. So I chose a  pouring guru , Tiktus color art, and got to work.

What do you guys think of my ~acrylic pouring adventure~?

I build up a new enduro MTB before going to Germany to ride the sickest jumps and freeride MTB lines of the year! How sick is this bike?

Thanks to Ghost bikes I was able to receive this amazing new bike, the 4.7 slamr which is a 140mm front and 130mm rear suspension enduro bike which doubles up as a big slopestyle bike and its perfect! I build up the bike at home and do some fresh modifications to the bike including new halo wheels and Magura brakes before heading for a tiny test ride at my local woods. I also introduce you to my new car that i'm sure you will love! After landing a couple of tricks at home it was then time to leave and make my way across Europe into Germany to ride the Audi Nines freeride event. On arrival at the Audi Nines quarry I jump straight into a course walk through all of the new features that are on offer throughout this crazy bikers dream! For today's video I session the slopestyle line on my new enduro bike and end up pulling off some sick tricks that i never though would be possible on this bike. I will be out here in Germany for a week filled with riding with my jump bike, downhill bike, electric bike and my new enduro mountain bike! I'm very excited to see what the week brings, what tricks would you like to see? Let me know in the comments!! 


I hope you enjoy the video!

I FINALLY moved in my #college apartment! Come along with me as I pack up my Jeep and head out on the 19hr drive to Utah, move my stuff in, and shop for room decor! Then watch my final GOODBYES with my mom and dad! 

✅ Check out my NEW IG PHOTO DOODLES  Photo Presets, & Stickers HERE: https://brooklynandbaileyshop.com/collections/presets-doodles 

My dad drove with me out to Utah, and it was a LOOOOONNNNGGGG day! We drove it all straight through, no stops for meals, only three gas stops and two sites along the way... the Cadillac Ranch outside Amarillo, TX and the Breaking Bad house in Albuquerque, NM. We pulled into my grandparent's house at about 2:30am and crashed!

The next morning, my mom flew in to help me and my dad move my stuff in #movein. We also shopped pretty much for two days straight trying to get apartment and room decor. Since we were unable to visit the property before signing the lease and getting to Utah (due to the pandemic), we had no idea how the room looked and what the lighting situation looked like. So we opted to buy pretty much anything I needed there, rather than haul pre-bought stuff out in a U-Haul only to find that it didn't work with the room/lighting. We much have visited 7-8 Targets trying to get the right stuff! We weren't counting on over 70,000 students being in Provo/Orem area all on the same weekend moving into BYU and Utah Valley University!

Since I am starting college as a Sophomore in credits, I opted for an apartment with my own room instead of a #dormroom.  After we decorated my room, it was time to say goodbye to my parents. I had just left the rest of the family in Texas a few days earlier, so I was getting used to it by now. It was still sad, but I'm super excited to be in college, get to know my roommates, enjoy the outdoors, and be closer to my extended family!

Thousands have told me that anyone can easily miss my first automatic basketball hoop by missing the hoop entirely. That is a really good point and something that I can't let stand. In this video I show you how I devoted several weeks of my life to realizing a basketball hoop that makes your shot go in even if you totally miss the hoop.... it was a lot of fun, and quite a bit more challenging than I was anticipating. Hopefully you enjoy it :)

This project was really hard. It was a huge challenge to whittle the 450gigs of footage down into a video that shared my journey of designing and getting this machine working. I hope you enjoyed it :) If you are interested in helping to support me making more of these videos you can check out my Patreon at http://patreon.com/stuffmadehere. One question - would a podcast be interesting yes / no? I've been considering that as an opportunity to share more details and whatnot that can't make it into my videos."

No, it was not.
The utter lack of care and direction regarding the sequel trilogy has me beyond bothered. I found it hard to find my words in this first time reaction and realization that we've really truly been all lied to regarding everything.

The Mandalorian is all I have to look forward to.
With Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni behind Star Wars, there is hope. As far as the sequels go, they're no longer in my timeline of Star Wars canon.

I don't think the actors should ever be to blame. Neither should the writers and directors. You can't expect them to understand Star Wars. The higher ups who sign off on such a thing, especially when appointed by George Lucas like KK was, should have put her foot down and really course corrected things.

Everything is so messed up, and the final nail is in.
I hope things continue under Favreau. He is a new hope.

'The Mysterious Affair' With Harrison Roach","17","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N7AGpCPinGA/default.jpg","63861","1752","14","0","224","False","False","","The dancing dandy starring in the film above is Mr. Harrison Roach, one of the darlings of the post-modern ride-anything movement. 

For the last 10 years Harry and a handful of  open-minded  free surfers have managed to scrape livings as an aspirational, relatable, journeyman aesthete. For Harry and surfers like him, their marketability has come not in spite of, but because of, his abstinence from anything like mainstream high-performance equipment, ie. the modern thruster. 

And this makes some people very angry. 

Many of you watching this right now have long held the belief that the heavily-glassed, elegantly tinted alternative equipment these “hipster kooks” ride has concealed fundamental flaws in their surfing. 

 Put these guys on a real surfboard,  you say.  Then we’ll see how pretty they look.”

This is what happens when you put one of surfing’s foremost alternative stylists on teamlite foam and fiberglass."

Behind the Scenes Video of how we built it: https://youtu.be/E60G3ba4TUA 
⇊  Click below for more links!  ⇊

I have been wanting to build this thing as long as I understood the physics of how it all works.  A super big thanks to David Linderman, Jeremy Fielding, Trent, and David Woodall (the welder).

I realize most people who support Smarter Every Day don't do it for  transactional  reasons, (ie, I'll support Smarter Every Day to get stuff).  I also realized that there is often a mental hurdle that must be crossed before support on Patreon starts.  My thought is that I'd really like to give folks a baseball, and it might provide enough momentum to get over that initial hurdle.  I signed the first shipment of baseballs I received, but I only have so many of those.  There's no implication that my signature is worth anything.... it's just kind of what you do with baseballs... it's a tradition.  After a certain number, it will transition to unsigned baseballs.  I've got enough signed baseballs to over all existing Patrons, and many more, but I will wait a month or so to see how many I need to get, then I'll order the second batch.  I like to support jobs and pay people for what they're good at.  The machinists and welders who made the parts in this video for example.  The whole intent here is to diversify away from solely being ad sponsored so I don't have to answer to anyone but myself and Patrons with respect to the types of content I choose to make.  Thank you for understanding what I'm doing here, and even if you decide not to kick in at https://www.patreon.com/smartereveryday , I'm super grateful you took the time to watch this video!  
Thank you very much, 

Destin

When I was younger, my favorite baseball players were Cal Ripken Jr. and Nolan Ryan https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Ryan

Nolan Ryan's fastball has been beat, but when adjusted for radar gun placement it may still be the fastest pitch ever:

For 2021 he replaces Sergio Perez, and will slot in alongside Lance Stroll. It's a marquee signing for the team's Aston rebrand next year, and gives it a world champion driver at a time when it wants to take the next step up to becoming a race-winning team. But is success for this partnership a slam dunk? In this video, Scott Mitchell looks at the risks on both sides, as Vettel hopes the team can build some real upward momentum, Racing Point banks on getting the fired-up version of Vettel, and we take a moment to spare a thought for Perez for being left on the sidelines by a team he has played a pivotal role with for many years.

If you draw up a map, trace a line connecting the island of Bermuda, Puerto Rico, Miami, and back to Bermuda, what do you get?  Yes, it’s a triangle – a sinister polygon known for mysteriously swallowing over 2,000 ships and 200 aircraft over centuries! And here's a story about the Bermuda Triangle you probably didn’t hear about. 

So, the airplane involved was a Beechcraft Bonanza single-engine aircraft. Onboard, pilot Bruce Gernon had two passengers: his father and business partner. They took off from Andros Island in the Bahamas and headed northwest for the Florida coast. It was December 4, 1970. This was a typical flight Bruce had made dozens of times before!

There hasn't been a whole lot of footage of Kelly surfing in Indo over the last few years, so it feels pretty special to have him here in Bali during a swell. 

Speaking of which, it got quite solid the following day with some very good and consistent Padang Padang. 

The crowd was thick but Robert still managed to snag a few good ones - so check in again at 7pm Bali time for tomorrows Padang Padang clip.
