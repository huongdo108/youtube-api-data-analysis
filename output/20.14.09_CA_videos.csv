They are frequently served with roast dungeness crab, but they work well on their own.

Garlic Noodles
Serves 2-3

Ingredients:
250g (1/2 pound) dry spaghetti, or 150g (1/3 pound) fresh egg noodles

2 tablepsoons butter
12 cloves garlic, minced
15ml (1 tablespoon) oyster sauce
10ml (2 teaspoons) soy sauce or Maggi seasoning
10ml (2 teaspoons) fish sauce
30g (1 ounce) grated Parmesan or Pecorino cheese
Thinly sliced scallions (optional)

1. Cook the pasta according to package instructions in unsalted water (the sauce is very salty; if using fresh noodles, cook them at the start of step 2). Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large skillet or saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant but not browned, about 2 minutes. Add the oyster sauce, soy sauce, and fish and stir to combine.

2. Using tongs, transfer the cooked noodles to the garlic sauce. Increase heat to high, add cheese and scallions, and stir and toss vigorously until the sauce is creamy and emulsified, about 30 seconds. If sauce looks too watery, let it keep reducing. If it looks greasy, splash some more pasta water into it and let it reemulsify. Serve immediately."

Today is a super exciting nw project, I've NEVER seen anyone do this before, Jackie from NerdEcrafter and I have decided to try customizing plushies for the first time. This is a lot like squishy makeovers, but with plushies instead!

Since this has never been done before, we are having to get very experimental. I ended up using a combination of techniques and materials to give my plushie a makeover. I will be doing some basic sewing, gluing, using felt, ribbon, and lots of fabric paint as usual! We decided to us Squishmallows to customize since they are so simple and really cute. Get ready for some cute plushie creations üòä

___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________

Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL). 

CURRENT SERIES:
Squishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewers
Thrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard sales
Bake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real life

As I currently don't know what to restore next, I decided to make the 8 ball. It was a very cool little project. Very accurate work was needed to get all six individual pieces fit together with no gaps. The hardest part of this project was filming the last few shots, because it is so super shiny now and reflects everything. I really like how it turned out and it will be a nice decoration piece to look at.

I hope you like my work and the video.

Lyrics:
Had to do maybach 
I can‚Äôt do a regular Benz 
I like the seats that recline 
Know I‚Äôm dog 
Yes I‚Äôm fuckin her and her friend 
I like em two at a time 
And She wanna slide she pull out her insta and shit
She go if she fuck up the vibe 
How am I 23 sittin on 23 I feel like Jordan 
I‚Äôm back in my prime (2x)

This years in the makin shit why would I lie 
Dreamed of the whip now I don‚Äôt even drive 
I got a chauffeur 
She told me I‚Äôm drivin her crazy 
She hate what I‚Äôm doin online 
10 in a week and I‚Äôm just not suprised
I had to take that one home to the guys 
I got the feds watchin 
Haters watchin 
News watchin that‚Äôs a whole lotta eyes 
I went and Flooded my wrist 
For the fuck of this shit 

While these rappers just run out of time 
I‚Äôm here forever 
This lives televised 
Ain‚Äôt no way they could take none from any of mine 
That boy a vette 
And he still on the rise 
Rolls or the Bentley shit I can‚Äôt decide 
I got the paparazzi at the front of my door 
I can‚Äôt leave shit I need a disguise

Had to do maybach 
I can‚Äôt do a regular Benz 
I like the seats that recline 
Know I‚Äôm dog 
Yes I‚Äôm fuckin her and her friend 
I like em two at a time 
And She wanna slide she pull out her insta and shit
She go if she fuck up the vibe 
How am I 23 sittin on 23 I feel like Jordan

[Lyrics]

Si on jou ou ta kite T√® sa
F√≤m ta ale a Nasa e
map mandon Fuze ki ka mennenm kote ou ye
E si m pata la on bagay ta rivew 
 sonje ke tout bagay  ka chanje 
e nenpot sa ki ta pase 
m‚Äôpwomet ou mwen pap janm kanpe 

Mwen santi mwen byen pou ou
menmsim ta eseye 
mpap janm kpab san ou
tout k√® kontan mwen e bon√®m 
se gras a ou 
e si mwen ta mouri map retounen pou ou 

Mwen santi mwen byen pou ou
menmsim ta eseye 
mpap janm kapab san ou
tout k√® kontan mwen e bon√®m se gras a ou 
e si mwen ta mouri map retounen pou ou  hhou 

‚Ä¢mo pa mwen yo pap janm sifi an reyalite
e mwen di Bondye m√®si paskew toujou la b√≤ kotem
mwen vlew konnen ke map renmenw pou let√®nite
e l√® mwen diw wi
mwen diw wi pou let√®nite
l√®m b√≤ kote ou sa ka pa parfait men ou pi bon
e chak detay pi bon ke tout  sak te pase avan
tandon pwol 
e l√® nap fe lanmou ansanm nou pa gen position (non)
nap moutre tout mond lan ke nou gen on vr√® lanmou
ou av√®m ka  ansanm,eh
pansew pap la  se sel bagay ki ka toumantem 
em mwen vle tout mond lan konnen kem pap janm separew 


Mwen santi mwen byen pou ou
menmsim ta eseye 
mpap janm kapab san ou
tout k√® kontan mwen e bon√®m se gras a ou 
e si mwen ta mouri map retounen pou ou 
 
 
Mwen santi mwen byen pou ou 
menmsim ta eseye

Loyal Theorists, you may be thinking,  Matpat, how can you possibly know off of the trailer?  Never doubt my ability to theorize out of the smallest details!

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be haunted by Colonel Sanders? What could make such a thing a reality? That's where today's theory starts! You see in Japan KFC is HUGELY popular, so much that there are even statues of the Colonel himself. Would you believe that one of those statues is responsible for a CURSE put on a Japanese baseball team? Theorists, this is about to get WEIRD!

Hope For The Day (HFTD) is a non-profit movement empowering the conversation on proactive suicide prevention and mental health education. Join the Proactive Suicide Prevention conversation at http://www.hftd.org 

Suicide Prevention starts with a conversation we're not having with our mental health due to Stigma. The first step to breaking that silence is dispelling stigmas of fear, judgement, and shame about our internal experiences. We achieve that by proclaiming It's Ok Not To Be Ok!

Lyrics:
Feeling like a drop in the ocean that don‚Äôt nobody notice
Maybe it‚Äôs all just in your head
Feeling like you‚Äôre trapped in your own skin, and now your body‚Äôs frozen
Broken down, you‚Äôve got nothing left
When you‚Äôre high on emotion and you‚Äôre losing your focus and you feel too exhausted to pray
Don‚Äôt get lost in the moment or give up when you‚Äôre closest, all you need is somebody to say
It‚Äôs okay not to be okay
It‚Äôs okay not to be okay
When you‚Äôre down and you feel ashamed
It‚Äôs okay not to be okay
Feeling like your life‚Äôs an illusion and lately you‚Äôre secluded
Thinking you‚Äôll never get your chance
Feeling like you got no solution, it‚Äôs only ‚Äòcause you‚Äôre human
No control its out of your hands 
When you‚Äôre high on emotion and you‚Äôre losing your focus and you feel too exhausted to pray
Don‚Äôt get lost in the moment or give up when you‚Äôre closest, all you need is somebody to say
It‚Äôs okay not to be okay
It‚Äôs okay not to be okay
When you‚Äôre down and you feel ashamed
It‚Äôs okay not to be okay
When you‚Äôre high on emotion and you‚Äôre losing your focus and you feel too exhausted to pray
Don‚Äôt get lost in the moment or give up when you‚Äôre closest, all you need is somebody to say
It‚Äôs okay not to be okay
It‚Äôs okay not to be okay
When you‚Äôre down and you feel ashamed
It‚Äôs okay not to be okay
It‚Äôs okay not to be okay

Letra/Lyrics:

KENDO
Burberry, Fendi, se prende el amor
Rojo, sangre, el aventador
A gorilla glue huele el interior
Y la medusa se enculebra en la 22

ANUEL
Richard Miller, en mi mano de cazador
La pinta completa de Christian Dior
Esta noche no quiero un error
Hacemos una porno y yo voy a ser el director

KENDO
Contigo no me pongo necio
Baby ese toto lo aprecio
Porque t√∫ tienes valor
Pero muchas solo tienen precio

ANUEL
Se te humedeci√≥‚Ä¶cuando te toque baby
Don don don don don
Contigo puedo ser fiel
T√∫ estas en otro nivel
Baby don don don don don

DADDY YANKEE
Te llevo conmigo a viajar en el jet
Mi aerol√≠nea t√∫ la tienes de UBER
Eso est√° temblando c√≥mo San Andr√©s WO!
Ojitos verdes como mo√±a de Vancouver
Dale ma oh!
Sigo pasando por el GO
Batman en el Murci√©lago
Tengo las pacas TOA ALTA
Ellos las tienen TOA BAJA
Date un shot de tequila te est√° invitando el Patr√≥n
Si quieres jugar con Jordan ven y caile
Te voy a dar el √∫ltimo baile
Hay fuego en el 23
Las botellas toa‚Äô llegan via express
Y s√≠guelo no le bajamos
A este nivel donde estamos
Si mueves el bote ma‚Äô te lo anclamos
Nadie nos quita el sue√±o por eso roncamos

ANUEL
Se te humedeci√≥‚Ä¶cuando te toque baby
Don don don don don
Contigo puedo ser fiel
T√∫ estas en otro nivel,
Baby don don don don don

KENDO
El amor no se nos cae
C√≥mo la tarjeta que no da decline
20,000 en la Montclair y pedales Off-White
Los Benjamin soy el Dios del rap
El odin, yo no uso Louis Vuitton si no es con la Supreme

ANUEL
Se te mojaron los labios
Los de la boca y los de abajo
Mami te quiero ver estoy en Ibiza bebe
Yo te viajo

KENDO
Solo disfruta de la vista
Que voy a llevarte pa broncearte las playas nudistas
Pa' que nos tiren fotos imprevistas
Y nos vamos viral en portadas de revistas

DADDY YANKEE
Se te humedeci√≥‚Ä¶cuando te toque baby
Don don don don don
Contigo puedo ser fiel
T√∫ estas en otro nivel,
Baby don don don don don

ANUEL
El Lambo rojo como hell boy
Amarillo bumble bee el Rolls Royce
Los AKA y R en mi convoy
Y la baby es rubia Marylin Monroe

Baby yo te rompo la tanga
Real Hasta La muerte Mi ganga
De Kylie Jenner el maquillaje
Y la crema Versace pa' los masaje

Champa√±a y sexo, ye
Marijuana
El momento es perfecto
Para perdernos y matar las ganas

Champa√±a y sexo, ye
Marijuana
El momento es perfecto
Para perdernos y matar las ganas

KENDO
Se te humedeci√≥‚Ä¶cuando te toque baby
Don don don don don
Contigo puedo ser fiel
T√∫ estas en otro nivel,
Baby don don don don don

For 2021 he replaces Sergio Perez, and will slot in alongside Lance Stroll. It's a marquee signing for the team's Aston rebrand next year, and gives it a world champion driver at a time when it wants to take the next step up to becoming a race-winning team. But is success for this partnership a slam dunk? In this video, Scott Mitchell looks at the risks on both sides, as Vettel hopes the team can build some real upward momentum, Racing Point banks on getting the fired-up version of Vettel, and we take a moment to spare a thought for Perez for being left on the sidelines by a team he has played a pivotal role with for many years.

House of Cards Lyrics 

Ate lunch with the devil was dancing with death
I‚Äôm making the most of the chance I have left 
One hand to the sky one hand on my chest , 
If you asked if I‚Äôm scared then the answer is yes 
I done been up I don‚Äôt been poor 
Not even a dollar I slept on the floor 
A mountain of problems that can‚Äôt be ignored
I came from the bottom to settle the score 
Lord gave me a shot with this music 
I promised him no more excuses 
Been trying so hard you can tell by my scars that my past has been so damn abusive 
It‚Äôs fine I tell you what the truth is 
Some days I swear I feel useless my happiness has been elusive 
I had an encounter with Judas 
Somewhere in the dark along the line I lost my mind 
The old me is a prisoner that‚Äôs somewhere lost in time 
I had family I treated right that tried to take my life 
Look at my back and you want find no room to put another knife 


Chorus

I lost my mind I got no shame and I keep trying not to cry
I‚Äôve got this ice running through my veins and I got fire in my eyes

All the things that I‚Äôve done in the darkness all the nights that my mind was at war
I‚Äôm down in my soul there‚Äôs one thing I know heaven Ain't a place you go looking for

They all fall down just like a house of cards they all fall down heaven ain't a place you go looking for


Verse 2 
Hold up, hold up pass me the weed and let‚Äôs roll up
Been struggling trying to get sober fuck it pass me the drink and let‚Äôs pour up
But don‚Äôt ask what‚Äôs in my Styrofoam
If you can tell the lights are on but there ain‚Äôt nobody home
Then blowing this killer shit
You can tell that I‚Äôm feeling it
You can tell that I‚Äôm really lit 
Out of body experience
Back in my zone back in my bag I ain‚Äôt been the same since that happened to dad
I‚Äôve been barefooted while walking on glass surrounded by flames with a can fulla gas 
Ready for war put on my armor
I‚Äôm doing this for my son and my daughter
As I kneel down at the foot of my father 
Left all my problems right there at the altar
And he washed away every sin
Now I‚Äôm back and I‚Äôm better than I ever been


Chorus

I lost my mind I got no shame and I keep trying not to cry
I‚Äôve got this ice running through my veins and I got fire in my eyes

All the things that I‚Äôve done in the darkness all the nights that my mind was at war
I‚Äôm down in my soul there‚Äôs one thing I know heaven Ain't a place you go looking for

They all fall down just like a house of cards they all fall down heaven ain't a place you go looking for"

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit ‚Äî stripped-down sets, an intimate setting ‚Äî just a different space.

For her Tiny Desk (home) concert, Phoebe Bridgers chose the White House. OK, maybe it's a green screen, but she and her team created a sweet mock-up of the Oval Office, with Phoebe performing behind a very special desk. It's a far cry from the hotel bed in Austin we first filmed Phoebe on back in 2017, but her ambitions and talent run high. She played the Tiny Desk later that year and returned with newfound bandmates, Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker, as boygenius one year later. But there was more to come when she surprised us all for a magical collaboration with her musical hero Conor Oberst as Better Oblivion Community Center just six months later.

Phoebe and bandmates Marshall Vore on drums and Harrison Whitford on guitar perform three songs from her brilliant new album, Punisher. They open with  Kyoto,  a story song based on her first trip to Japan, followed with a sweet version of  Moon Song  and the sad details of loving someone who doesn't love themself. And then comes the kicker, as Phoebe introduces herself with the words  I hope everybody's enjoying their apocalypse,  as the band kicks into her surreal doomsday tune  I Know the End.  And what an end it is: The trio expands to an ensemble and a crowd-sourced chorus of fans ‚Äî recording from bedrooms, cars, backyards and trampolines ‚Äî lets out the kind of cathartic scream that has come to define 2020 for so many of us.

Phoebe for President, 2020.

Thousands have told me that anyone can easily miss my first automatic basketball hoop by missing the hoop entirely. That is a really good point and something that I can't let stand. In this video I show you how I devoted several weeks of my life to realizing a basketball hoop that makes your shot go in even if you totally miss the hoop.... it was a lot of fun, and quite a bit more challenging than I was anticipating. Hopefully you enjoy it :)

Although very fun, these videos are very time consuming and expensive. Please consider helping to support the development of these projects through my patreon at http://patreon.com/stuffmadehere

This project was really hard. It was a huge challenge to whittle the 450gigs of footage down into a video that shared my journey of designing and getting this machine working. I hope you enjoyed it :) If you are interested in helping to support me making more of these videos you can check out my Patreon at http://patreon.com/stuffmadehere. One question - would a podcast be interesting yes / no? I've been considering that as an opportunity to share more details and whatnot that can't make it into my videos."

No, it was not.
The utter lack of care and direction regarding the sequel trilogy has me beyond bothered. I found it hard to find my words in this first time reaction and realization that we've really truly been all lied to regarding everything.

The Mandalorian is all I have to look forward to.
With Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni behind Star Wars, there is hope. As far as the sequels go, they're no longer in my timeline of Star Wars canon.

I don't think the actors should ever be to blame. Neither should the writers and directors. You can't expect them to understand Star Wars. The higher ups who sign off on such a thing, especially when appointed by George Lucas like KK was, should have put her foot down and really course corrected things.

Everything is so messed up, and the final nail is in.
I hope things continue under Favreau. He is a new hope.

This, as six homes, vehicles, sheds, three shops and farming equipment were destroyed after a wild brush fire in Graham. Governor Inslee has pledged to help hard hit counties. 

Meanwhile, Seattle police said they arrested 22 people during the initial confrontation and confiscated some unexploded Molotov cocktails.

Check out https://aatishb.com/maskmath to explore and for references.

This video is about how masks (whether surgical, or N95, or cloth) are counterintuitive and actually work much better epidemiologically than one might expect. Masks do double-duty, and the fraction of interactions with masks is much higher than the fraction of people wearing masks, so partially adopted, partially effective masks are able to reduce the basic reproduction number surprisingly well.
