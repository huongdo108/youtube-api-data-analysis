Oscar  nominee  Denis  Villeneuve  (“Arrival,”  “Blade  Runner  2049”)  directs  Warner  Bros.  Pictures  and  Legendary Pictures’ “Dune,” the big-screen adaptation of Frank Herbert’s seminal bestseller of the same name. A mythic and emotionally charged hero’s journey, “Dune” tells the story of Paul Atreides, a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding, who must travel to the most dangerous planet  in  the  universe  to  ensure  the  future  of  his  family  and  his  people.  As  malevolent  forces  explode  into conflict over the planet’s exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence—a commodity capable of unlocking humanity’s greatest potential—only those who can conquer their fear will survive.The film stars Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet (“Call Me by Your Name,”  “Little Women”), Rebecca Ferguson  (“Stephen  King’s  Doctor  Sleep,”   “Mission:  Impossible  –  Fallout”),  Oscar  Isaac  (the “Star  Wars” franchise) Oscar nominee Josh Brolin (“Milk,” “Avengers: Infinity War”), Stellan Skarsgård (HBO’s “Chernobyl,” “Avengers: Age of Ultron”), Dave Bautista (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “Avengers: Endgame”), Stephen McKinley Henderson (“Fences,” “Lady Bird”), Zendaya (“Spider-Man: Homecoming,” HBO’s “Euphoria”), Chang Chen (“Mr.  Long,” “Crouching  Tiger,  Hidden  Dragon”),    David  Dastmalchian  (“Blade  Runner  2049,”  “The  Dark  Knight”), Sharon  Duncan-Brewster  (“Rogue  One:  A  Star  Wars  Story,”  Netflix’s “Sex  Education”),   with  Oscar  nominee Charlotte Rampling (“45 Years,” “Assassin’s Creed”), with Jason Momoa (“Aquaman,” HBO’s “Game of Thrones”), and Oscar winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men,” “Skyfall”).   Villeneuve directed “Dune” from a screenplay he co-wrote with Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth based on the novel of the same name written by Frank Herbert.  Villeneuve also produced the film with Mary Parent, Cale Boyter  and  Joe  Caracciolo,  Jr.   The  executive  producers  are  Tanya  Lapointe,  Joshua  Grode,  Herbert  W.  Gains, Jon Spaihts, Thomas Tull, Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt and Kim Herbert. Behind  the  scenes,  Villeneuve  reteamed  with  two-time  Oscar-nominated  production  designer  Patrice  Vermette  (“Arrival,”  “Sicario,”  “The  Young  Victoria”),  two-time  Oscar-nominated  editor  Joe  Walker  (“Blade  Runner  2049,”  “Arrival,”  “12  Years  a  Slave”),  two-time  Oscar-winning  visual  effects  supervisor  Paul  Lambert  (“First Man,” “Blade Runner 2049”), and Oscar-winning special effects supervisor Gerd Nefzer (“Blade Runner 2049”).    He  also  collaborated  for  the  first  time  with  Oscar-nominated  director  of  photography  Greig  Fraser  (“Lion,”  “Zero  Dark  Thirty,”  “Rogue  One:  A  Star  Wars  Story”);  three-time  Oscar-nominated  costume  designer  
Jacqueline West (“The Revenant,” “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” “Quills”) and co-costume designer Bob Morgan; and stunt coordinator Tom Struthers (“The Dark Knight” trilogy, “Inception”).  Oscar-winning and multiple  Oscar-nominated  composer  Hans  Zimmer  (“Blade  Runner  2049,”  “Inception,”  “Gladiator,”  “The  Lion King”) is creating the score.  Warner  Bros.  Pictures  and  Legendary  Pictures  Present  “Dune.”    The  film  is  slated  to  be  released  in  theaters on December 18, 2020."

Lyrics:
Had to do maybach 
I can’t do a regular Benz 
I like the seats that recline 
Know I’m dog 
Yes I’m fuckin her and her friend 
I like em two at a time 
And She wanna slide she pull out her insta and shit
She go if she fuck up the vibe 
How am I 23 sittin on 23 I feel like Jordan 
I’m back in my prime (2x)

This years in the makin shit why would I lie 
Dreamed of the whip now I don’t even drive 
I got a chauffeur 
She told me I’m drivin her crazy 
She hate what I’m doin online 
10 in a week and I’m just not suprised
I had to take that one home to the guys 
I got the feds watchin 
Haters watchin 
News watchin that’s a whole lotta eyes 
I went and Flooded my wrist 
For the fuck of this shit 

While these rappers just run out of time 
I’m here forever 
This lives televised 
Ain’t no way they could take none from any of mine 
That boy a vette 
And he still on the rise 
Rolls or the Bentley shit I can’t decide 
I got the paparazzi at the front of my door 
I can’t leave shit I need a disguise

Had to do maybach 
I can’t do a regular Benz 
I like the seats that recline 
Know I’m dog 
Yes I’m fuckin her and her friend 
I like em two at a time 
And She wanna slide she pull out her insta and shit
She go if she fuck up the vibe 
How am I 23 sittin on 23 I feel like Jordan 
I’m back in my prime (2x)"

The new trailer for The Batman starring Robert Pattinson looks very interesting... and surprisingly familiar? You see, with all of the hints hidden in the newest trailer - and I don't mean the riddles - I think I've figured out the ending twist of this movie! Loyal Theorists, you may be thinking,  Matpat, how can you possibly know off of the trailer?  Never doubt my ability to theorize out of the smallest details! You see, I think the big twist of this movie will be that The Batman is actually... well you'll need to watch to find out!

Apologies for the long absence, but we are trying to get things back on track. No, this video didn’t take us 3 months to make - we filmed a bunch of videos in July and this is the first of them to be released! It’s not a magnum opus, just supposed to be fun and lighthearted. If you want to read more about our plans, you can check out my blog post here:

https://www.safiyasnewintrosong.com/single-post/2020/09/04/where-have-we-been

Now, onto the video! A few weeks ago, somewhere deep in a visual ASMR YouTube rabbit hole, I discovered the online acrylic pour art community - where people essentially make interesting color combos of paint in a cup, then pour that cup onto a canvas or object - and then manipulate that object to create truly mesmerizing, rainbow, psychedelic pieces of art. And I was instantly hooked - just something about the way the paints flow from the cup and then slide around the canvas really got me, ya know? So I decided to pick an acrylic pour art video and try to follow it myself, to see if I could do it too. So I chose a  pouring guru , Tiktus color art, and got to work.

What do you guys think of my ~acrylic pouring adventure~?

Behind the Scenes Video of how we built it: https://youtu.be/E60G3ba4TUA 
⇊  Click below for more links!  ⇊

I have been wanting to build this thing as long as I understood the physics of how it all works.  A super big thanks to David Linderman, Jeremy Fielding, Trent, and David Woodall (the welder).

I realize most people who support Smarter Every Day don't do it for  transactional  reasons, (ie, I'll support Smarter Every Day to get stuff).  I also realized that there is often a mental hurdle that must be crossed before support on Patreon starts.  My thought is that I'd really like to give folks a baseball, and it might provide enough momentum to get over that initial hurdle.  I signed the first shipment of baseballs I received, but I only have so many of those.  There's no implication that my signature is worth anything.... it's just kind of what you do with baseballs... it's a tradition.  After a certain number, it will transition to unsigned baseballs.  I've got enough signed baseballs to over all existing Patrons, and many more, but I will wait a month or so to see how many I need to get, then I'll order the second batch.  I like to support jobs and pay people for what they're good at.  The machinists and welders who made the parts in this video for example.  The whole intent here is to diversify away from solely being ad sponsored so I don't have to answer to anyone but myself and Patrons with respect to the types of content I choose to make.  Thank you for understanding what I'm doing here, and even if you decide not to kick in at https://www.patreon.com/smartereveryday , I'm super grateful you took the time to watch this video!  
Thank you very much, 

Destin

Why Great White Sharks Are
Not Kept In Aquariums
If you&#39;ve ever been to an Aquarium, you would notice one thing immediately. Well, not immediately, but
you would notice it eventually.
And it&#39;s the fact that the Aquarium has no great white shark. And that&#39;s not only true for the Aquarium
in your state alone. It&#39;s true for Aquariums all over the world.
But why is this so? Why can&#39;t we capture Great White Sharks and get them in Aquariums? Are they
impossible to capture, or have we not just thought of it?
Well, there are ten good reasons why you&#39;ve never seen a Great White Shark in an Aquarium, and you
only need to continue watching to learn these ten reasons.
Reason one will definitely make you mushy.
#10 They Are Difficult To Capture
First off, let&#39;s get a few things straight. A lot of Aquariums have tried to capture Great White Sharks. It
has just proven to be impossible.
This is because a Great White Shark is one of the hardest sharks to capture. This is not only because it is
large, but because it is also quite aggressive. For example, man could only even capture one as recently
as 1955.
While, you might say that 1955 isn&#39;t that recent, and that&#39;s true. But we don&#39;t even know when man
learned to capture wild animals like lions and tigers. Our ancestors have been doing that for so long that
many kings had tamed wild animals in their palaces.
However, our first attempt at taming a Great White Shark came just about 70 years ago. To make things
worse, that first attempt was a failure. The first great white shark to be held in captivity was just held for
less than a day.
So yeah, before you can even think of having a great white shark in an Aquarium, you have to capture it
first— and we can tell you that that&#39;s not easy.
At all
#9 They Are Difficult To Transport

Great White Sharks are large animals. Some reach up to twenty feet and they can weigh up to 1,100
kilograms. That&#39;s a lot.
And one thing that we&#39;ve learnt over the years is that transporting an animal of that size from one side
of the ocean to another isn&#39;t the easiest thing in the world.
For some Aquariums, the trouble just isn&#39;t worth it. Given that Great Whites are difficult to capture, the
fact that Aquariums have to go through so much hassle to transport them again just makes the whole
venture unrealistic.
We know what you must be thinking— well, aren&#39;t orcs and dolphins in Aquariums? Well, none of them
is quite as large and as aggressive as Great White Sharks. That&#39;s why they are called Great White Sharks.
#8 Lack Of Resources
How rich do you think your regular Aquarium is? Do you think they are rolling in wads of cash, or do you
think they are struggling to get by?
Don&#39;t worry, your answer literally doesn&#39;t matter. The fact is that it&#39;s way too expensive to catch a Great
White Shark, and many Aquariums don&#39;t just see it as being worth it.
Scientists say that to catch a Great White Shark, you&#39;d have to provide a few things. The first thing you&#39;d
need to provide is a tank and an open water pen. This is because you can&#39;t just tag a Great White Shark,
drug it, put it in ice, load it in a plane, and then fly it over to wherever the Aquarium is.
It just doesn&#39;t work that way.
To transport even a small Great White Shark, you&#39;d have to have an open water pen that can hold at
least 3.78 million litres of water with a depth of at least 10.6 meters. In addition to that, the Aquarium
has to keep the Great White in an open water pen that can take 15 million litres of water before even
transferring it to the Aquarium&#39;s facilities.
As you can see, all this will cost a lot of money, and only a few Aquariums can actually afford to pay this
much to have a Great White Shark.
But what of those who can pay? Why don&#39;t they have a Great White Shark?


#5 They Are A Danger To Others And
Themselves
If a Great White Shark is kept with any other shark, the likelihood that the Great White kills it and eats it
within a day or two is very high. So, not only is catching a Great White Shark as a chore on its own, it can
even be expensive in other ways.
Imagine buying a pet and finding out that that pet killed the other pet that you had before. That&#39;s
exactly how it is like.

And as you may know, the other marine animals that the Great White may kill are actually pretty
expensive to get. It&#39;s not an easy task getting them, and most Aquariums can&#39;t deal with sharks killing
each other in their facilities.
To make things worse, Great White Sharks rarely allow even human beings to feed them. This
sometimes leads them to die of starvation."

Let’s face it, you have likely been told that eating carbohydrates is making you fat. While there may be some truth to the rumor, it is only because you have been eating them excess. That said, there are some built-in pitfalls that make including carbs in our diets something that we have to be mindful of, however I am going to show you what those are and how to work around them in this video.

The key to fat burning is that you need to be in a hypocaloric state. Due to the tendency we have of overeating carbs there is some logic to the fact that by eliminating them from our diets we will consume fewer calories overall. That said, the replacement of the carbs has to come from somewhere. In the case of keto diets it comes in the form of fats and proteins, mostly from dietary fats. 

The issue with this approach is that the macronutrient we are replacing them with is twice as calorie dense as the carbohydrates themselves. 

Not to mention, it is often the case that the method we use to lose fat and drop weight in the first place is the one we are going to have to continue to use if we want to see long term permanent changes. It is here that I find the keto diet approach difficult to sustain.

So, instead of looking to exclude carbohydrates from your meal plan you need to learn to coexist with them.

That doesn’t mean that there aren’t pitfalls that we need to be mindful of however. First there is no denying the fact that carbs taste better and create more cravings than say isolated proteins or fats. It is likely due to the fact that our brains are hard wired to seek out sugars and glucose to fuel its function. Beyond that however is the additional information that carbs are not nearly as satiating as fats or proteins.

So there are definite reasons for why many people are trying to reduce them or even eliminate them from their diets these days but again, I do not believe this sets you up best for long term success. Any diet plan that is deprivation based, while it may help you to lose fat in the short term is not going to be something you can stick with forever.

In general, there are three main categories; simple sugars, complex starches and fibers. Eating carbohydrates from the fibrous carb category will have the least pronounced negative impact on rapidly raising your blood sugar levels and resultant insulin spikes.

The additional fiber present in these foods not only blunts this effect but also makes them more “bulky” food options. Add in the healthy nutrient boost these foods provide with them with plenty of vitamins and minerals and it is easy to see why the majority of the carbs you eat when you are trying to lose fat should come from here.

The simple sugars are the nutrient low carbs that are worth eliminating from your diet if you want to be ripped and lean year round. It is here that many will reach for these types of foods when enjoying a cheat meal or day. It is here however that if you delve too often, you will find frustration in not being able to achieve the body fat levels you are after.

The starchy carbs are the ones we perceive as generally “healthier” but can still present hardship if we overeat them. These are the oats, grains, pastas, breads, etc. This is the area that I believe we need to learn how to include in our meal plans and put to work fueling our bodies and muscles if we want to see the best results not to mention long term sustainability. 

Beyond the identification of the types of carbs however we need to employ additional strategies to keep them helping us and not hurting our fat loss efforts. Learn the composition of the carbohydrates you are eating. Aim for carbs that provide no more than 10-20 percent of their total carbs from sugars. This information is easily available online. 

Watch the video I have on dividing your plate for success and entertain the idea of a low fat diet as an alternative to low carb eating for a more sustainable plan.

And lastly, don’t forget to train with weights to compliment your diet to lose fat. Building lean muscle is always going to help you in your efforts to lose body fat. The more lean muscle you have the more storage capacity you have for blood glucose in the form of muscle glycogen. 

The bottom line is, if you are looking for how to lose fat and want a step by step plan for getting it done permanently, you need a complete plan with workouts and meal plans laid out for you day by day. Those are all available for you at athleanx.com via the link below.

As wonderful as that is, unfortunately, there are some costs.

Today is a super exciting nw project, I've NEVER seen anyone do this before, Jackie from NerdEcrafter and I have decided to try customizing plushies for the first time. This is a lot like squishy makeovers, but with plushies instead!

Since this has never been done before, we are having to get very experimental. I ended up using a combination of techniques and materials to give my plushie a makeover. I will be doing some basic sewing, gluing, using felt, ribbon, and lots of fabric paint as usual! We decided to us Squishmallows to customize since they are so simple and really cute. Get ready for some cute plushie creations 😊

___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________

Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL). 

CURRENT SERIES:
Squishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewers
Thrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard sales
Bake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real life
Create This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)

كلمات الأغنية


حبيبي بالبُنط العريض
غالي واقرب م الوريد
حالتي تتشخص جُنون
بيقولولي انا بيك مريض

أتاري كُل ما احب فيك 
بدمنك وبقيت مزاج
أتلحق بقى دي ف إيديك
ما انت في لُقاك العلاج

آه لقيت الطبطبه
واقوى لو ما انتش بعيد 
ضحكتك فيها كهربا
بابقى زي واحد جديد

حبيبي خدها ومني ليك
مشتريك آه مشتريك
فوق ما تتصور كمان
والوحيد ولا ليك شريك

لو انا هوصفك اوصف ايه
عُقد فُل ابيض وفيه
قلب بيدلدق حنان
مِـلكي بقى وانا أدرى بيه 

آه لقيت الطبطبه
واقوى لو ما انتش بعيد 
ضحكتك فيها كهربا
بابقى زي واحد جديد

I need to plan the emigration properly so to make it as sooth as possible for the ants and the queen. What I observed during the move was incredible and an experience I'll never forget.

It was the wreck of a Nazi warship, off the coast of Norway. The remains of the German boat were first detected by sonar three years ago. But when crews from a Norwegian power company were able to examine the wreck more closely, they were startled to find that it was emblazoned with a swastika. The Norwegian Maritime Museum was able to confirm that the old hulk was the German cruiser “Karlsruhe.”"

Which team will claim the crown in the end? Enjoy watching!  #BeachVolleyballWorld #KingOfTheCourt #Utrecht2020

RULES OF KING OF THE COURT:
It wasn’t the usual two teams against each other, but five (respectively four and three) teams battled it out in rotational matches, with one team eliminated per match. There was a Challenger’s and a King’s side. Challengers served and points could only be scored on the King’s side. If the Kings won a rally, they got one point and stayed in their kingdom. If they lost, they were out and were sent to the back of the line of waiting teams. Challengers then moved into the King’s end to face the next team. The team with the least points on the buzzer was out.

All this happened to a ticking clock, adding another level of excitement to King of the Court tournaments. Round one and finals lasted max. twenty minutes, while round two lasted sixteen. In the finals, the first team to reach 15 points won, or whoever had the highest score after 20 minutes won.

Alex Lacazette, debutant Gabriel and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang were on target while the outstanding Willian claimed two assists on his first appearance for us.

Fulham were bright in the opening moments and a misjudgement from Gabriel almost let in Aboubakar Kamara. Bernd Leno did well to claw the ball off his toes.

From then on, the home side could not live with our pace, movement and quality.

The first goal was a scrappy one. Mohamed Elneny found Aubameyang and his cutback was fired goalwards by Granit Xhaka. Tim Ream failed to clear, Willian reacted first to force a save from Marek Rodak and Lacazette tucked away the rebound.

Willian struck a free-kick against the base of a post with Rodak beaten, and Aubameyang almost scored from a trademark burst in behind the defence in the left-hand channel.

Gabriel grew in stature as the game unfolded and he marked his debut with a downward header to convert Willian's corner. That effectively put the match to bed very early in the second half.

After that it was a matter of how many we would score, and Aubameyang got the third and final goal thanks to a delightful crossfield pass from Willian and one of the captain's sumptuous finishes into the far corner.

There will be tougher tests ahead, but this was a hugely-encouraging start to the new campaign.

I'm ready to ruin your childhood once again! Today, I've set my eyes on Ratatouille - or more specifically our little rat chef Remy. Such a good guy right? WRONG! Remy is a JERK! Throughout the entire movie, he's only out for himself with no concern about his so-called  friends . What evidence do I have to back this up? Who is the REAL person (or rat) you should be rooting for? Time to find out!

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches.

Well gals and guys, this is it. This is the end of the epic saga of the 350z builds. We finally figure out if more expensive means more better. Is Hi Car actually faster than Low Car?

What do you think the presidential candidates should be talking about? http://vox.com/ElectionVideos 

All of recorded human history has happened during a period in which the average global temperature didn’t change by more than 1 degree Celsius. But the burning of fossil fuels has triggered a temperature rise projected to exceed 3 degrees by the end of the century. It will be catastrophic. But it can be avoided if we massively scale back the burning of fossil fuels.

The US isn’t the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, but it's emitted more carbon dioxide in total than any other country. So the US has an important role to play in global decarbonization; the world basically can’t get there without the US’s full participation. But the current US president doesn’t have any plans to do that. His Democratic challenger in the 2020 election, Joe Biden, does.

Biden’s plan is ambitious: Its goal is to completely transition the US to clean energy by 2050. But his plan doesn’t get into the details of exactly how that will happen. For that, we talked to physicist and engineer Saul Griffith, who took us through his incredibly detailed road map for how the US could actually walk away from fossil fuels in the next 30 years.

This video is the first in our series on the 2020 election. We aren’t covering the horse race; instead, we want to explain the stakes of the election through the issues that matter the most to you. To do that, we want to know what you think the US presidential candidates should be talking about. Tell us here: http://vox.com/ElectionVideos

For 2021 he replaces Sergio Perez, and will slot in alongside Lance Stroll. It's a marquee signing for the team's Aston rebrand next year, and gives it a world champion driver at a time when it wants to take the next step up to becoming a race-winning team. But is success for this partnership a slam dunk? In this video, Scott Mitchell looks at the risks on both sides, as Vettel hopes the team can build some real upward momentum, Racing Point banks on getting the fired-up version of Vettel, and we take a moment to spare a thought for Perez for being left on the sidelines by a team he has played a pivotal role with for many years.

Rick says, “It was just such a shock that I didn’t know how to deal with it.”

Kristin and Rick say Robbie has been in treatment for the past year and is due to come home soon, and they don’t know what to do. Can Dr. Phil help?

It's official, Neymar has left Nike and has signed a new boot deal with Puma! The internet's reaction to this move has been a mixed bag, but overall I think it was a solid move for both parties. Neymar got paid and Puma got a very high-profile, and more importantly, a very influential footballer to help bring people to the brand and hopefully sell some boots. What could go wrong? Well, they could have Neymar wear the Puma King...

While this is all just a matter of opinion, in this video I share my thoughts on this big move, and what I believe is already a huge mistake being made by Puma in utilizing Neymar to sell more football boots. Was this the right decision? Will the Puma King be able to make a comeback? Let's talk about that.

Tony Hawk challenged me to do a kickflip. I can't do a kickflip. So Activision hired us to make a Self-Kickflipping Skateboard to help me achieve my 30 year old dream of being able to do a kickflip (and to help promote the new remastered version of THPS 1+2!) Will we succeed?! Find out in this episode of Make it Real. 

PS: Hey @Braille Skateboarding -- ever seen one of these before!?

Deep in tropical jungles lie floating kingdoms ruled by beautiful and deadly masters: They are sort of the high elves of the ant kingdoms: Talented architects that create castles and city states. But they are also fierce and expansionist warriors and their kingdoms are ensnared in a never ending war for survival. Oecophylla weaver ants.

I bought this wrecked, totaled, and very cheap Volkswagen Phaeton at the salvage auction. This car is very similar to the Bentley Continental Flying Spur and the Audi A8. When it was picked up, it was damaged at the auction likely by a forklift driver. We get the majority of the body damage repaired, and begin this rebuild project, but I'm not sure I want to finish this VW. Needless to say I sold it in very short order...

Çukur 4.Sezon 1.Bölüm Özet:

Çukur, en büyük düşmanıyla savaşa girmek üzeredir. Emir’in Erdenet’ler hakkında yaptığı haber Çukur ve Erdenet’leri bir kez daha karşı karşıya getirecek. Yamaç ve Arık kozlarını birebirde paylaşırken Yamaç, en büyük Erdenet’in dikkatini çekecek. Erdenetler ve Çukur arasındaki savaşta bütün dengeleri değiştirecek kişi olan Cengiz, Yamaç hakkında önemli bir karar verecek. Cengiz’in Yamaç hakkındaki planı büyük merak uyandırırken Arık’ın bir sonraki hamlesi ise Yamaç’ı yüzleşmeye en korktuğu şeyle karşı karşıya getirmek olacak. Koçovalıların evinde düğün hazırlıkları sürerken Karaca’nın kendi kaderini çizmek için kurduğu gizli planlar Azer dahil herkesin hayatını etkileyecek. Ailesini bir arada tutmak ve mahallesini korumak için her şeyi yapan Yamaç’ın aylardır kaçtığı kabusla yüz yüze geldiği anlar nefesleri kesecek.

This week after Death Valley hit the hottest temperature ever recorded... We decided to go and experience what 130F or 56C felt like... Both the best and worst idea we've ever had.

Does anyone read the description? I never really know to be honest. Well either way, this is Thomas and I'm a bit bored writing this so I'll just keep typing random things and see if anybody will notice. Conor was really upset that we kept him farting in the video so please ignore that part (or don't). Anyways, hope you liked the video we're actually pretty stoked with how it came out!

Check out Conor's channel here and tell him we sent you it'll make him very happy!

Hope For The Day (HFTD) is a non-profit movement empowering the conversation on proactive suicide prevention and mental health education. Join the Proactive Suicide Prevention conversation at http://www.hftd.org 

Suicide Prevention starts with a conversation we're not having with our mental health due to Stigma. The first step to breaking that silence is dispelling stigmas of fear, judgement, and shame about our internal experiences. We achieve that by proclaiming It's Ok Not To Be Ok!

Lyrics:
Feeling like a drop in the ocean that don’t nobody notice
Maybe it’s all just in your head
Feeling like you’re trapped in your own skin, and now your body’s frozen
Broken down, you’ve got nothing left
When you’re high on emotion and you’re losing your focus and you feel too exhausted to pray
Don’t get lost in the moment or give up when you’re closest, all you need is somebody to say
It’s okay not to be okay
It’s okay not to be okay
When you’re down and you feel ashamed
It’s okay not to be okay
Feeling like your life’s an illusion and lately you’re secluded
Thinking you’ll never get your chance
Feeling like you got no solution, it’s only ‘cause you’re human
No control its out of your hands 
When you’re high on emotion and you’re losing your focus and you feel too exhausted to pray
Don’t get lost in the moment or give up when you’re closest, all you need is somebody to say
It’s okay not to be okay
It’s okay not to be okay
When you’re down and you feel ashamed
It’s okay not to be okay
When you’re high on emotion and you’re losing your focus and you feel too exhausted to pray
Don’t get lost in the moment or give up when you’re closest, all you need is somebody to say
It’s okay not to be okay
It’s okay not to be okay
When you’re down and you feel ashamed
It’s okay not to be okay
It’s okay not to be okay
